         seater Bentley and its topless
       And shes topless naked bitch driver

       QTip 
      We dont believe you cause we the people
      Ill still be in the rear yo we dont need you
      You aint a killer nor good young nigga move
      When we get hungry we eat the same ing food
      The ramen noodle
      Your simple voodoo is so maniacal
      Reliable to pull a juju
      The irony is that this bad bitch in my lap
      She dont love me she make bunnies she gon study that
      She gon give it to me aint gon tell me run it back
      She gon take the brain or weather plain she spit on that
      The doors are signed with dont try to rhyme with
      VH  has a show that you could waste your time with
      Guilty pleasures take the edge off reality
      And for a salary Id probably do that shit sporadically
      The OG Gucci wasnt spittin with iguanas
      The IRS piranha see a nigga gettin commas
      Niggas in the hood living in a fishbowl
      Gentrify here now its not a shit hole
      Trendsetter I know my shits cold
      I aint said it yet because I aint so bold hey yo
       QTip 
      All you Black folks you must go
      All you Mexicans you must go
      And all you poor folks you must go
      Muslims and gays
      Boy we hate your ways
      So all you bad folks you must go
       Phife Dawg 
      The fog in the smog of new media that logs
      False narratives of guys that came up against the odds
      We not just nigga rappers with the bars
      Its kids with that be cosmic with the stars
      You bastards overlooking street art
      Better yet street smarts
      But you keep us off the charts
      So mother your numbers and your statisticians
       you know about true competition
      Just like the  picture that talking about he hittin
      The only ones whos hitting are the ones that currently spittin
      We got your missie smitten rubbing on a little kitten
      Dreaming of a world thats equal for women with no division
      Boy I tell you thats vision
      Like Tony Romo when he hitting Witten
      To try and be the best in they division
      Shaheed Muhammad cut it with precision
      Who can come back years later still hit the shot
      Still yall tryna move me off the ing block

      All you Black folks you must go
      All you Mexicans you must go
      And all you poor folks you must go

       Hello its me
       I was wondering if after all these years youd like to meet
       To go over everything
       They say that times supposed to heal ya but I aint done much healing
       Hello can you hear me
       Im in California dreaming about who we used to be
       When we were younger and free
       Ive forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
       Theres such a difference between us
       And a million miles
       Hello from the other side
       I mustve called a thousand times to tell you
       Im sorry for everything that Ive done
       But when I call you never seem to be home
       Hello from the outside
       At least I can say that Ive tried to tell you
       Im sorry for breaking your heart
       But it dont matter it clearly doesnt tear you apart anymore
       Hello how are you
       Its so typical of me to talk about myself
       Im sorry I hope that youre well
       Did you ever make it out of that town
       Where nothing ever happened
       Its no secret
       That the both of us are running out of time
       So hello from the other side
       I mustve called a thousand times to tell you
       Im sorry
       for everything that Ive done
       But when I call you never seem to be home
       Hello from the outside
       At least I can say that Ive tried to tell you
       Im sorry for breaking your heart
       But it dont matter
       it clearly doesnt tear you apart anymore
       but it wont
       anymore
       anymore
       anymore
       Hello from the other side
       I mustve called a thousand times
       to tell you
       Im sorry
       for everything that Ive done
       But when I call you never seem to be home
       Hello from the outside
       At least I can say that Ive tried
       to tell you
       Im sorry for breaking your heart
       But it dont matter
       it clearly doesnt tear you apart anymore"

Its like a diamond ring
Its a precious thing
And we never want to lose it
Its like a favorite song
That we love to sing
Every time we hear the music
Were in this love together
We got the kind that lasts forever
Were in this love together
And like berries on the vine
It gets sweeter all the time
Its like a rainy night in candlelight
And ooh its so romantic
We got the whole thing working
out so right
And its just the way we planned it
Tell ya
Were in this love together
We got the kind that lasts forever
Dont you know
Were in this love together
And like berries on the vine
It gets sweeter all the time
Were in this love together
We got the kind that lasts forever
Were in this love together
And like berries on the vine
It gets sweeter all the time"

      Ive been standing at the edge of the water
      Long as I can remember never really knowing why
      I wish I could be the perfect daughter
      But I come back to the water no matter how hard I try
      Every turn I take every trail I track
      Every path I make every road leads back
      To the place I know where I can not go though I long to be
      
      See the line where the sky meets the sea It calls me
      And no one knows how far it goes
      If the wind on my sail on the sea stays behind me
      One day Ill know if I go theres just no telling how far Ill go
      
      Goohohohohohohohohoh
      
      I know everybody on this island seems so happy on this island
      Everything is by design
      I know everybody on this island has a role on this island
      So maybe I can roll with mine
      I can lead with pride I can make us strong
      Ill be satisfied if I play along
      But the voice inside sings a different song
      What is wrong with me
      
      See the light as it shines on the sea Its blinding
      But no one knows how deep it goes
      And it seems like its calling out to me so come find me
      And let me know whats beyond that line will I cross that line
      
      See the line where the sky meets the sea It calls me
      And no one knows how far it goes
      If the wind on my sail in t he sea stays behind me

      Deeper than the eyes can find it
      Maybe we have made her blind

       Its Christmas time
       Theres no need to be afraid
       At Christmas time
       We let in light and we banish shade
       And in our world of plenty
       We can spread our smile of joy
       Feel your arms around the world at Christmas time
       But say a prayer
       And pray for the other ones
       At christmas time its hard
       But while your having fun
       Theres a world outside your window
       And its a world of dread and fear
       Where a kiss of love can kill you
       Where theres death in every tear
       And the Christmas bells that ring there
       Are the clanging chimes of doom
       Well tonight were reaching out and touching you
       Bring peace and joy this Christmas to West Africa
       A song of hope where theres no hope tonight ooh
       Why is comfort to be feared
       Why is to touch to be scared
       How can they know its Christmas time at all
       Heres to you
       Raise a glass to everyone
       Heres to them
       And all there is to come
       Can they know its Christmas time at all

       Let them know its Christmas time again
       Feel the world
       Let them know its Christmas time again

      Insanely perverted rapey and scurvy
      They blame me for murdering Jamie Lee Curtis
      Said I put her face in the furnace beat her with a space heater
      A piece furniture egg beater thermos
      It may be disturbing what Im sayings cringe worthy
      But Im urinating on Fergie call Shady number   
      Surely Im turning into the Aaron Hernandez of rap
      State of emergency the planets having panic attacks
      Bradys returning matter fact I may be deserving
      Of a Pat on the back like a Patriots jersey
      Inexplicable stomach growl from the pit of it
      Like a ing Terrier hittin it
      Despicable dumb it down ridiculous
      Tongue is foul shoot off at the ing mouth
      Like a missile a thunder cloud
          pound pistol pull the trigger this gun will sound
      And youll get a round like Digital Underground
      And  Ann Coulter with a Klan Poster
      With a lamp post door handle shutter
      A damn bolt cutter a sandal a can opener a candle rubber
      Piano a flannel sucker some hand soap butter
      A banjo and manhole cover
      Hand over the mouth and nose smother
      Trample ran over the tramp with the Land Rover
      The band the Lambo Hummer and Road Runner
      Go ham donut or go Rambo gotta make an example of her
      Thats for Sandra Bland ho and Philando
      Hannibal on the lamb no wonder I am so stubborn
      Im anti cant no government handle a commando
      Your man dont want it Trumps a bitch
      Ill make his whole brand go under yeah
      And tell Dre Im meeting him in LA white bronco like Elway
      Speeding Im bout to run over a chick Del Rey CD in
      Females stay beatin em bet you theyll lay bleeding
      And yell Wait pleading but screaming is pointless
      Like feeding Michelle helium
      Leaving them pale faced medium sized welt
      Straight treating em like a cell mate
      See me Im climbing hells gate
      Bitch Im like your problems selfmade

       Right now Im calling you from my home gym
       Right after that  Im gon swim
       Just did a couple laps in my home pool
       And my daughter right there getting homeschooled

        starting up my own school
       A Montessori and the hallway looking like a monastery
       Oh yes Im way up I feel blessed

Intro Big Sean
Uhhuh is it time

Verse   Big Sean
Look I spent my whole life tryna improvise
Im not saying that shit for you to sympathize
Spent my whole life tryna find the light thats at the end of the tunnel
I should have realized it was inside
So lately I been trying to get whats inside outside
So many people wanna see my insides outside
Im from that city four hours east of Southside
Where everyone outside but dont fuck with no outsiders
Going up with the ones I hold it down with
Whole city got my back on some photobomb shit
Whole city blowing up on some old Saddam shit
Before this I was the one hoes tried to go to prom with

Refrain Big Sean
You know take the fame take the crib take our cars
Now we gotta take the train hood niggas takin chains
Slavemaster take our names    take the shot
And young souls take the blame man but they cant take away
The light

Chorus Jeremih  Big Sean
No matter how much they gon shade you
No man they cant fuck with the light
They cant stop the shine
They cant fuck with the light
Hell nah the boys that bright
Even if you take away my life you cant take the light
No matter how much they gon shade you

Verse   Big Sean
Got the whole city on fire
Boy this the flow that got Steph Curry inspired
This the flow that got Lebron James finna rewire
This the flow that got my whole family finna retire
Flows on flows I might drown in this bitch
Ye found a pro I guess Im profound in this bitch
My dad from Louisiana man the smallest town
Where if they know youre brown they might hold you down and even hose you down man
Since Im his son I feel like I gotta stunt hard
I took the hand that they gave me and played the Donald Trump card
And realized counting money never feel as good as counting blessings
And a loaded mind is more dangerous than a loaded weapon

Refrain Big Sean
So when they take the fame take the crib take our cars
Now we gotta take the train and hood niggas takin chains
Slavemaster take our names    take the shot
And young souls take the blame man but they cant take away
The light

Chorus Jeremih  Big Sean
No matter how much they gon shade you
No man they cant fuck with the light
They cant stop the shine
No man they cant fuck with the light
Hell nah the boys that bright
Even if you take away my life you cant take the light
No matter how much they gon shade you

Outro Jeremih
Dont let them take away your soul
No no No no
Dont let them take away what makes you whole

Chorus
All that shit you told me I believed
The smile on your face the only thing I cant read
Left and now you back inside my life
Its gon take more than that to set it right though
Cause you so fuckin outta line
For ever letting them taste whats mine
Taste whats mine taste whats mine
You so fuckin outta line

Verse  
Feel like you owe me checks owe me time owe me sex
Long nights no reply I got no regrets
You disrespect disrespect only time I seen you nows on the internet
Just to see if its somebody else that you tied to
I hit you back when I decide to you got my tattoo we was tribal
Then you left and we turned rivals now you back its our revival
They dont make you feel like I do they didnt make you perform for me
You was my American Idol how you rocked the mic
Man we went from long text now they shorter than a haiku
Seems like all you got is hate for me
All you ever did was take from me
Cause you know you got that walk from me
How you dress and how you talk from me yeah
Lets not ever disrespect what I meant to ya
It took us being over to see all I did for ya damn

Chorus
All that shit you told me I believed
The smile on your face the only thing I cant read
Left and now you back inside my life
Its gonna take more than that to set it right though
Cause you so fuckin outta line
Forever letting them taste whats mine
Taste whats mine taste whats mine
You so fuckin outta line

Verse  
Im just trying to let the past pass
Aint no future in that yeah
I stay     like my dash yeah
Have you cummin faster than The Flash yeah
Is it all mine all mine You know me I had to ask
Can I hit it like I crash Sipping pinot by the glass glass
Honestly I had to take the time to let my ego go
Realized that that held us back and backs not where we need to go
This dont replace what you did to me
This dont replace what I did to you
Sometimes it aint about what we did or didnt do
Its about what we getting through
Look Im not tryna play the blame game
Point the fingers while we skip the point
Knowing that we both want the same thing
Riding for each other even if we gotta change lanes
If we dont work it out shame shame
I cant touch these hoes I cant trust I dont wanna have a fake us

Chorus
But all that shit you told me I believed
The smile on your face the only thing I cant read
Left and now you back inside my life
Its gon take more than that to set it right though
Cause you so fuckin outta line
Forever letting them taste whats mine
Taste whats mine taste whats mine
You so fuckin outta line

Outro
My friends say I should be over you
Getting hurt every time Im close to you
I think me and you are overdue
I think this is what we supposed to do
Cause you so fuckin outta line
Forever letting them taste whats mine
Taste whats mine taste whats mine
You so fuckin outta line

      We both regret some of the things we said
      But we love the way it ends
      Sometimes I think
      We hurt each other just because were in a league
      Sometimes I think
      Were fighting just to be lovers not so woundlessly

      How come we just cant get along

      The way we fuss the way we fight

      how bout maybe tonight
      We make up without a fight

      But its really something when we do

Verse  
When Im sitting in traffic some afternoon
Or bored to death in some waiting room
Im gonna close my eyes and picture you
Today

Verse  
You keep brushing that hair back out of your eyes
It just keeps falling and so do I
Well Im feeling like the luckiest man alive
Today

Chorus
I dont know about tomorrow
But right now the whole world feels right
And the memory of a day like today
Could get you through the rest of your life

Verse  
I know it wont always be like this
Life could change as quick as a kiss
Its not over yet and I already miss
Today

Chorus
I dont know about tomorrow
But right now the whole world is right
And the memory of a day like today
Could get you through the rest of your life

Bridge
And as the seasons change and time goes bye
When your hair is grey and so is mine
I know for sure that youre gonna be
Just as beautiful as you are to me
Today

Bring on tomorrow Ive got today
Bring on tomorrow Ive got today
Bring on tomorrow right now the whole world is right
Bring on tomorrow

Outro
Because a memory of a day like today
Could get you through the rest of your life

I think I see confetti from this potion

Building up your fortress like a mountain
Neighbors say were causing a commotion

No one but no one but you and I I I
We aint gonna sleep tonighighight
Oh baby no one but no one but you and I I I

Put on our music that makes us go fuckin crazy go

       Jenny grew up wild like a blackfoot daisy
       Out in the shack with a blue tick hound
       Broke as hell but blessed with beauty
       The kind that a rich man cant turn down
       She caught the eye of an oil man dancing
       One summer night in a dime store dress
       She had the looks he had the mansion
       And you can figure out the rest
       It was all roses dripping in diamonds
       Sipping on champagne
       She was all uptown wearing that white gown
       Taking his last name
       She could hear those church bells ringing ringing
       And up in the loft that whole choir singing singing
       Fold your hands and close your eyes
       Yeah its all gonna be alright
       And just listen to the church bells ringing ringing
       Yeah theyre ringing
       Jenny was hosting Junior League parties
       And having dinner at the country club
       Everyone thought they were Ken and Barbie
       But Ken was always getting way too drunk
       Saturday night after a few too many
       He came home ready to fight
       And all his money could never save Jenny
       From the devil living in his eyes
       It was all bruises covered in makeup
       Dark sunglasses
       And that next morning sitting in the back pew
       Praying with the baptist
       She could hear those church bells ringing ringing
       And up in the loft that whole choir singing singing
       Fold your hands and close your eyes
       Yeah its all gonna be alright
       You just listen to the church bells ringing ringing
       Yeah theyre ringing
       Jenny slipped something in his Tennessee whiskey
       No law man was ever gonna find
       And how he died is still a mystery
       But he hit a woman for the very last time
       She could hear those church bells ringing ringing
       Standing there in a black dress singing singing
       Fold your hands and close your eyes
       Yeah its all gonna be alright

       How does a moment last forever
       How can a story never die
       It is love we must hold onto
       Never easy but we try
       Sometimes our happiness is captured
       Somehow our time and place stand still
       Love lives on inside our hearts and always will
       Minutes turn to hours days to years and gone
       But when all else has been forgotten
       Still our song lives on
       Maybe some moments werent so perfect
       Maybe some memories not so sweet
       But we have to know some bad times
       Or our lives are incomplete
       Then when our shadows overtake us
       Just when we feel our hope is gone
       Well hear our song and know once more
       Our love lives on
       
       How does a moment last forever
       How does our happiness endure
       Through the darkest of our troubles
       Love is beauty love is pure
       Love pays no mind to desolation
       It flows like a river through the soul
       Protects perceives and perseveres
       And makes us whole
       Minutes turn to hours days to years then gone
       But when all else has been forgotten
       Still our song lives on
       How does a moment last forever
       When our song lives on"

Intro
Everybody we know does

Verse  
Not everybody throws their empties in a truck bed
Pours sweat off forty hours for a pay check
Take it to the bank at five save a nickel spend a dime
On living it up
Not everybody knows an outskirts sky glow
Yell turn it up sing every word of friends in low
Not everybody likes a Friday night
Covered in dust but everybody we know does

Chorus
Thats what we do thats what we love
Thats how we were raised how we grew up
Runs deep in our veins way down in our blood
Everybody we know does
Put your boots to the ground til the sun goes down
Kill a couple long necks til we come back around
Nah it aint no big deal around here for us
Everybody we know does

Verse  
Not everybody understands how we make it
Hold it together when we feel like breakin
Not everybody knows what were made of but
Everybody we know does

Chorus
Thats what we do thats what we love
Thats how we were raised how we grew up
Runs deep in our veins way down in our blood

Verse  
Well Ive woke up in places that I couldnt remember
Whos lying next to me or even how I got there
Thats hard to believe but thats how I used to roll
One Tuesday night in an underground pool hall
Thats where I saw her for the first time
Right around last call
She stole my heart and I started walking down a new road

Chorus
And when Im holdin her
Its like peace on Earth
Where time stands still
Loves the only thing yeah that I feel
When shes in my arms
No matter where we are
Well I am right at home when Im holdin her

Verse  
On a park bench down on  th Street
Thats where I popped the question
And to my amazement she actually said yes
And tears filled my eyes as I slipped that ring on her hand
And then a few short years later God put into my world
A   pound and   ounce sweet baby girl
And ever since that day let me tell you know
I became a brand new man because

Chorus
When Im holdin her
Its like peace on Earth
Where time stands still
Loves the only thing yeah that I feel
When shes in my arms
No matter where we are
Well I am right at home when Im holdin her

Outro
I am right at home
When Im holdin her

      Street lights along the highway
      Throwing shadows in the dark
      And the memories keep on turning
      To the rhythm of a broken heart
      You only need a roof when its raining
      You only need a fire when its cold
      You only need a drink when the whiskey
      Is the only thing you have left to hold
      Sun comes up and goes back down
      And falling feels like flying till you hit the ground
      Say the word and Ill be there for you
      Baby I will be your parachute
      Parachute
      Theres a song that I remember
      I never learned to play
      And a lifetime of forgotten words
      I never got to say
      You only need a roof when its raining
      You only need a fire when its cold

       And they want us back
       Its like theres always an empty space

       Of how bright we burned well now it hurts
       But its true
       When they think of me they think of you
       They keep asking how I am
       But theyre really asking where youve been
       I can read between all of the lines
       It aint just us missing all of the times
       We were the life of the party
       We used to be the ones that they wished they were

      I feel terrible
      Sunlights hurting my eyes
      So I pull the shades and I make my place as black as night
      
      I feel miserable
      And Im missing you and me
      Another Sunday morning all alone underneath these sheets
      
      No Im not hungover its true
      But Im still not over you
      All messed up all strung out
      I was sitting at home breaking down
      Not out there getting high
      Underneath some neon lights
      Aint no whiskey strong enough to make things right
      
      Im just getting over
      Another sober Saturday night
      
      Besides the pain
      I dont feel a thing
      When my buddies call me up
      I just let it ring
      
      No Im not hungover its true
      But Im still not over you
      All messed up all strung out

       When I was young I would look in the mirror
       Didnt know it then but now it couldnt be clearer
       That I remember being filled with such wonder
       Before learning that the world could be harsher
       Who you love or the color of your skin
       Or the place that you were born and grew up in
       Shouldnt decide how you will be treated
       Cause were all the same when everybodys breathing
       Waiting for a change to set us free
       Waiting for the day when you can be you and I can be me
       Waiting for hope to come around
       Waiting for the day when hate is lost and love is found
       Waiting for a change waiting for a change
       Change change
       For all the brave and the souls who went before us
       Stand tall then proudly lift your voices
       Let em know who we are and our choices
       And one day we wont have to sing this chorus
       Waiting for a change to set us free
       Waiting for the day when you can be you and I can be me
       Waiting for hope to come around
       Waiting for the day when hate is lost and love is found

       Deep down Louisiana close to New Orleans
       Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
       There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
       Where lived a country boy name of Johnny B Goode
       He never ever learned to read or write so well
       But he could play the guitar like ringing a bell
       Go Go
       Go Johnny Go Go
       Go Johnny Go Go
       Go Johnny Go Go
       Go Johnny Go Go
       Johnny B Goode
       He use to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
       And sit beneath the trees by the railroad track
       Oh the engineers used to see him sitting in the shade
       Strumming to the rhythm that the drivers made
       People passing by would stop and say
       Oh my that little country boy could play Go Go
       Go Johnny Go Go
       Go Johnny Go Go
       Go Johnny Go Go
       Go Johnny Go Go
       Johnny B Goode
       
       His mother told him someday you would be a man
       And you would be the leader of a big old band
       Many people coming from miles around
       To hear you play your music when the sun go down
       Maybe someday your name will be in lights
       Saying Johnny B Goode tonight Go Go
       Go Johnny Go Go
       Go Johnny Go Go
       Go Johnny Go Go
       Go Johnny Go Go

      I tried hard to make you want me
      But were not supposed to be
      And the truth will always haunt me
      Even though it set me free
      And my tears fall like the ocean
      As they floated in the breeze
      They were falling in slow motion
      And they brought me to my knees
      Youre holding me toying with me all in my brain
      Turn off the light and now all of the maze
      Fills me with doubt
      And Im shouting your name out loud
      Why do you wanna put me through the pain
      I get the feeling Ill never escape
      I cant hide away from the shame of you
      Tears on the ground tears on my pillow
      You wont bring me down
      And Ill get over you
      These tears will get me through
      And Ill get over you
      Ill get over you
      Ill get over you
      Ill get over you
      Ill get over you
      When did you lose your emotion
      When did you become so cruel
      And if you want to cut me open
      Says a thousands words bout you
      And in time I know youll leave me
      Like a distant memory
      I know love can be so easy
      If I stop for loving me
      Youre holding me toying with me all in my brain
      Turn off the light and now all of the maze
      Fills me with doubt

When I was down when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink and loves a drug
Oh now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river dried up
You came to rain a flood

So high so high

Now Im feeling drunk and high
So high so high
Feeling drunk and high
Feeling drunk and high
So high

Life is a drink your loves about
To make the stars come out

       Girl you cant leave someone
       In the middle of a dance floor all alone
       In the middle of an old school country song

      But I treat you like my equal never lesser
      I was    years old when we had dropped this one amazing record

      At the restaurant with the why you got to stare face
      To know I either ball or I record over the snare and bass

      Sheesh at least if you real then I have to respect it
      Realize the energy you give is what you manifested
      So understand we positive as could be
      The vision is still intact the show is fresh out of seats
      Boy its never going south less we down in South Beach
      Khaled on the jet skiis preaching what you believe in
      Everything faster than food watch what we eating
      If it add a couple years to our life then we might go vegan
      Woah I hear a little bit of me in all your favorite rappers
      You know its true bitch I need respect due
      Now or later either way Imma take it just like its in taxes
      No wonder Im on fire I done been to hell and back bitch
      Lately I been living life in detachment
      I practice seven spiritual laws and cut off distractions
      We been all in the Hollywood hills aint never acting
      Detroit gave me an accent and Christ gave me his passion
      Father help us police doing target practice with real bodies
      Mommas in the streets crying standing over a still body
      Niggas over stressing we under investigation
      Every day off to the races cant  with you if you racist
      Beat your ass until you purple they cant even tell what your race is
      Doctor King meet Dr Dre except this doctor lost all his patience
      Have you tied up in a basement with you and your partner facing adjacent
      Until you deposit payment or reparations
      If you shoot me then you gotta deal with a holy me
      It feel like Im finally free and unlock my spirit with the holy key the holy key the holy key the holy key
      Hook Betty Wright  DJ Khaled
      And Ima celebrate it for a long time
      The drama couldnt break me now its all mine
      Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
      Holy holy holy holy key
      And Ima celebrate it for a long time
      The drama couldnt break me now its all mine
      Surrounded by my angels and we all shine

      Verse   Kendrick Lamar
      Everything I touch may disintegrate into dust uh huh
      Everything I trust may dishonor me in disgust come on
      Everything is everything affidavits and wedding rings
      Out for blood on my higher horse I report what it was
      I dont wear crosses no more Yeshuas coming back
      I aint scared of losses no more I see life in that
      I dont resonate with the concept of love and hate
      Cause your perspective is less effective and rather fake
      The universe and the heavens work in my DNA
      Kendrick said  mother Earth thats PSA
      The land of the wicked the foundation of Lucifers spirit
      Walking zombies and spellcatchers I pray for forgiveness
      Uncle Bobby and Paul June is lost again
      The underworld and the fourth dimension my familys in
      The big money the fast cars my life produced
      The blocks I connected while rebuilding this Rubix cube
      So what you look up to
      Fame and fortune bitches porches sources with designer thing
      Brand endorsement joining forces with sorcerers signing me
      Law enforcement their forces tortures us with violent speed
       you bosses employment my joy is to see all you bleed
      Who knew Royces with choices of color my desire need
      Crab and Oyster with gorgeous abortions I require thee
      Flesh and poison the point is the reason you wont die in peace
      Open door for my boy now they eating we say finally
      I destroy and divorce what you eating dont you hire me
      Tape recording my voices and tweak it lets play hide and seek
      Wall distortion and forfeit this evening you should try at least
      Im restoring the portrait of feasting nigga high on beast
      I dont like to sleep Im up like coyote I might OD
      Hair like ODB Im off a higher need
      Khaled is valid I been looking for inspiration
      But when you the only king you the only one in the matrix
      Hook Betty Wright  DJ Khaled
      And Ima celebrate it for a long time
      The drama couldnt break me now its all mine
      Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
      Holy holy holy holy key
      And Ima celebrate it for a long time
      The drama couldnt break me now its all mine

      To make it all alright all alright for us
      Ill promise to build a new world for us two
      With you in the middle
      Lying down beside you whats going through your head
      The silence in the air felt like my soul froze
      Am I just overthinking feelings I cant say
      This gut feeling Im tryna get off me as well
      I hope we find our missing pieces Im just sure

Chorus
Baby you dont have to rush
You can leave a toothbrush at my place at my place
We dont need to keep it hush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place at my place

Verse  
Stuck in a limbo half hypnotized
Each time I let you stay the night stay the night
Up in the morning tangled in sheets
We play the moment on repeat on repeat

PreChorus
When youre standing there in your underwear
And my Tshirt from the night before
With your messed up hair and your feet still bare
Would you mind closing the bedroom door

Chorus
Baby you dont have to rush
You can leave a toothbrush at my place at my place
We dont need to keep it hush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place at my place

PostChorus
I just I just cant let you go
Give me something Ive never known
So baby you dont have to rush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place at my place

Verse  
No need to question next time we meet
I know youre coming home with me home with me
Sweat like a sauna break up the ice
I know youre gonna stay the night stay the night

PreChorus
When youre standing there in your underwear
And my Tshirt from the night before
With your messed up hair and your feet still bare
Would you mind closing the bedroom door

Chorus
Baby you dont have to rush
You can leave a toothbrush at my place at my place
We dont need to keep it hush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place at my place

PostChorus
I just I just cant let you go
Give me something Ive never known
So baby you dont have to rush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place at my place

Bridge
Cause I dont want this to end
And theres no need to play pretend
If you stay with me again
Would you mind closing the bedroom door

Chorus
Baby you dont have to rush
You can leave a toothbrush at my place at my place
We dont need to keep it hush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place at my place

PostChorus
I just I just cant let you go
Give me something Ive never known
So baby you dont have to rush
You could leave your toothbrush at my place at my place

       Build our own family
       One day at a time
       Ten little toes a painted pink room
       Our beautiful baby looks just like you
       And well build this love from the ground up

       And I will be all you need

      I can honestly understand why its over
      I can go through the motions of walking away
      I can give you the key and take my things back
      I can find plenty of things to fill my days
                  But I dont know how not to
                  Think about you
                  When its late at night and quiet
                  And I know that I ought to be the one who
                  Is strong and just moves on
                  But Id probably turn down your road
                  Knock knock on your door
                  Fall back in your arms
                  Wake up in the morning
                  Hatin myself and the way that I cant help
                  The way I still want you

      Hello darkness my old friend
      Ive come to talk with you again
      Because a vision softly creeping
      Left its seeds while I was sleeping
      And the vision that was planted in my brain
      Still remainsWithin the sound of silence 
      In restless dreams I walk alone
      Narrow streets of cobble stone
      Neath the halo of a street lamp
      I turned my collar to the cold and damp
      When my eyes were stabbled by the flash of a neon light
      That split the night
      And touched the sound of silence
      And in the naked night I saw
      Ten thousand people maybe more
      People talking without speaking
      People hearing without listening
      People writing songs that voices never share
      And no one dare disturb the sound of silence
      Fool said I you do not know
      Silence like a cancer grows
      Hear my words that I might teach you
      Take my arms that I might reach you
      But my words like silent raindrops fell
      And echoed in the wells of silence
      And the people bow and prayed
      To the neon God they made
      And the sign flash out its warning
      In the words that it was forming
      And the sign said
      The words of the prophers are written the subway walls
      And tenement halls
      And whispered in the sounds of silence"

Oh well ship sailed
Still mine all mine

Hype Williams Big Pimpin yeah

OVO we a gold mine
But Im goin gold no time
Doing plat plat only
Boys better back off me
Hall of fame hall of fame
Like Im shirt off like Im shirt off
Like Im shirt off shorty
Whole city goin crazy
Whole city goin crazy
Top five no debatin
Top five top five top five
And the whole city rate me
And Im back inside The Matrix
And I said that we would make it

Looking for things you can find
Just so you can have something to bring up when its time
Mixing vodka and emotions tapping into your emotions
Dry cry cause Im hopeless
Choosey lover for the moment
Different story when I leave you
Story up just to keep you
I need you round I need you oh

Chorus PARTYNEXTDOOR  Jeremih
Its about us right now girl where you going
Its about us right now girl where you going
Im with you
Its all about us right now girl where you going
Its all about us right now girl where you going
Im with you Im with you

      Oh yeah yeah yeah
      Oh yeah yeah yeah
      Yeah look
      I dont know how to talk to you
      I dont know how to ask you if youre okay
      My friends always feel the need to tell me things
      Seems like theyre just happier than us these days
      Yeah these days I dont know how to talk to you
      I dont know how to be there when you need me
      It feels like the only time you see me
      Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently
      Yeah and last night I think I lost my patience
      Last night I got high as the expectations
      Last night I came to a realization
      And I hope you can take it
      I hope you can take it
      Im too good to you
      Im way too good to you
      You take my love for granted
      I just dont understand it
      No Im too good to you

      I just dont understand it
      I dont know how to talk to you
      I just know I found myself getting lost with you
      Lately you just make me work too hard for you
      Got me on flights overseas and I still cant get across to you
      And last night I think I lost my patience
      Last night I got high as the expectations

      I just dont understand it
      No Im too good to you
      Im way too good to you
      You take my love for granted
      I just dont understand it
      Years go by too fast
      I cant keep track
      How long did we last
      I feel bad for asking
      It cant end like this
      We gotta take time with this
      Cock up yuh bumper sit down pon it
      Let me see if this is something we can fix
      You got somebody other than me
      Dont play the victim when youre with me
      Free time is costing me more than it seems
      Sacrificing things
      And I wanna tell you my intentions
      I wanna do the things that I mention
      I wanna benefit from the friendship
      I wanna get the late night message from you from you
      I put my hands around you
      Gotta get a handle on you
      Gotta get a handle on the fact that
      Im too good to you
      Im way too good to you
      You take my love for granted
      I just dont understand it
      No Im too good to you

Intro
Yeah for the dogs dem you know
Man when shit gets like this man the whole city
Shits crazy right now and shit aint gonna stop
Know shit gonna get a lot more worse before it get any better

Verse  
Look momma hit my phone and said raps no good
Better than her telling me the checks no good
Now they wanna act like I do no good
Funny cause I really did more than I should
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
Cant get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it
You know    wants peace but Im down to cut ties for it
And I cant sleep these days unless I take one
If they dont have a story these days theyll make one
Life is always on man I never get a break from it
Doesnt matter where I go I can never get away from it
They give me loyalty and I dont gotta pay for it
Same way breads gotta break for it
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now
And I turn the six upside down its a nine now
I made a decision last night that I would die for it

Chorus
Dying yeah yeah gangstas gangstas gangstas
Dying yeah yeah gangstas gangstas gangstas
Dying yeah yeah gangstas gangstas gangstas
Dying yeah yeah gangstas gangstas gangstas

Verse  
All these hand outs man its getting outta hand
Ima start telling niggas Get it how you can
I got it right now so Im everybodys friend
If I ever lose I bet we never speak again
I made a decision last night Id die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
First place first place man we cant be tied for it
I only drove it five times paid     for it
Keychain go jangalang I wanna do major things
MJ in every way I just dont fade away
Six upside down its a nine now
Like Mannie like Stunna man shit is big time now
And I made a decision last night that I would die for it

Chorus
Dying yeah yeah gangstas gangstas gangstas
Dying yeah yeah gangstas gangstas gangstas
Dying yeah yeah gangstas gangstas gangstas
Dying yeah yeah gangstas gangstas gangstas

Outro
Make me feel the same way that I did to you
Trust me when I say I thought it all through
Trust me when I say that shit is old moves
God made himself a way from me to you
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views
Tried to kill me but I am very much alive on the six side
Yeah I said I am very much alive on the six side
I said I am

Intro Baka  Drake
Man dont live of a di hype huh
Real ting ay
Yeah

Verse   Drake
I pull up in Lexus like its   
I just hit a lick I got to hit a next one
Last year I know you learned your lesson
I could GPS you if you need addressin
Boss up Im the bigger homie
But Im one year older than my lil homie
   they was biddin on me
But Im Young Money got it written on me
Okay now we got some action
Everything I said it happened
That boy light as Michael Jackson
But on verses he been blackin
Chasin women a distraction
They wan be on TV right next to me
You cannot be here right next to me
Dont you see Riri right next to me
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Dont get along man we tried it
Whats the point in even tryin
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin to mention me
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give you the recipe
You know the game is sold separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me    at Tiffanys
Shout out to Tiffany Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I dont let it get to me

Chorus Drake
Done
Look what Ive done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me Im just dunning the hype
Me Im just dunning the hype
Me Im just done done done done done

Verse   Drake
I dont take this shit for granted
I do my own propaganda
I feel like Juelz Santana
Leg hangin out the Phantom
  cold like Alaska
Views already a classic
Roy outta here like NASA
Bustin  s out the plastic
Her gram too poppin to fuck her
The chain too heavy to tuck it Im serious
I feed my family with this
So dont play with my money this summer Im serious
I dont run out of material
You shouldnt speak on me period
You try to give em your side of the story
They heard it but they wasnt hearin it
They feeling a way and wont hide it
Niggas done being silent
Dont get along man we tried it
Whats the point of even tryin
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin to mention me
They gotta go they gotta go
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give em no empathy
Ima have Bs when Im   
They cannot fuck with the legacy
I dont know what else is left for me
After this no one a threat to me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I dont let it get to me

Chorus Drake
Done
Look what Ive done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me Im just dunning the hype
Me Im just dunning the hype

       How you can stand there is beyond me
       All of my lets just be friends are friends I dont have anymore
       How do you not check on me when things go wrong
       Guess I shouldve tried to keep my family closer
       Much closer
       All of my lets just be friends are friends I dont have anymore
       Guess thats what they say you need family for
       Cause I cant depend on you anymore
       Always saw you for what you couldve been
       Ever since you met me
       Like when Chrysler made that one car that looked just like the Bentley
       I always saw you for what you couldve been
       And even when its business with you its personal again
       I knew you before you made ends meet now were meeting our ends
       And its all because you chose a side
       Youre supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
       Guess it wasnt time
       And of course you went and chose a side that wasnt mine
       Youre so predictable I hate people like you
       Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you
       How you supposed to figure what Im going through
       You cant even figure out whats going on with you
       You judge fore you met me yeah it figures
       I make all the players anthems for the real niggas
       With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong
       Out here in LA I dont know whats going on
       I dont know whats going on
       And its all because you chose a side
       Youre supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
       Guess it wasnt time
       And of course you went and chose a side that wasnt mine
       You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
       My luck is a sure thing cause Im living right
       When I needed you you couldnt give me any advice
       But you always had something to say every other time
       Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way
       Im fooding and serving them all like Im working for minimum wage
       Someone up there must just love testing my patience
       Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
       Forgiveness for your ways
       If I ever loved ya Ill always love ya thats how I was raised
       Same way Im right here still feeling the way
       Same way Im realizing on a day to day
       All of my lets just be friends are friends I dont have anymore
       How do you not check on me when things go wrong

      I really used to feel like they loved a nigga at first

      Trust this little light of mine is going to shine positively
      Im just takin what God will give me
      Grateful like Jerry Bob and Mickey

      I know catching flies with honey is still sticky
      I wrote the book on worldclass finesses and tasteful gestures and makin efforts
      And never placin second
      And even better knowin youre first but then takin second
      Inspiring and never takin credit

      Way less important for my peers in recent years as I get established
      Unforgiving times but  it I manage
      Why is my struggle different than others
      Only child thats taking care of his mother as health worsens and bills double
      Thats not respectable all of a sudden
      I dont get a pat on the back for the come up
      What do you see when you see me
      When did all the things I mean from the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning
      Maybe I share it with too many people
      Back then it used to just feel like our secret
      Back when I would write and not think about how they receive it
      I be tryna manifest the things I needed
      And look now I mean its hard to believe it even for me
      But youre mindful of it all when your mind full of it all
      How did they go from not wanting me at all to wanting to see me lose it all
      Things get dark but my aura just starts glowing Im overcome with emotions
      Ones I cant access when Im stoned sober
      Jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra
      I could only speak what I know of
      Then we wrote a book on calculated thinking and icy Heineken drinking
      And rival neighborhoods linking
      And putting your trust into someone with the risk of financially sinkin
      All you did was write the book on garbage ass Rollies
      Ego strokin picture postin
      Claiming that youd do it for motivational purposes only but you just had to show me
      See I know cause I study you closely I know when someone lyin
      I notice people standing for nothing and gettin tired
      I know what were both thinking even when youre quiet

Intro
Yeah more yeah

Verse
More time with family and friends more life
More time to get it right
Its only me but Im seeing four shadows in the light
My demons visit me every night
To the most high Im forever indebted
I know I gotta pay somethin I know that days comin
I put it all in the music
Because if I dont say it here then I wont say nothin
Could feel my hand getting tired from holding the grudges
Two birds one stone my aim is amazin
I need to start losing my shit on you niggas thats hatin
Too reserved like I called ahead for me and my lady
Free C  how the fuck we got the boss waiting
Ever since the blue basement I found God and I lost patience
Between rocks and hard places of all places
Spotted everywhere like Dalmatian
Cops snoop around now cause all of my dogs famous
Please welcome the October fall baby
Vaughan Road Academy star playermy minds not all there
Used to carry a lot of dead weight like a pallbearer
People too scared to tell the truth so its all dares
Count it its all there and we all square
Quick money Im in and out
My dad used to use a soap bar til its thinnin out
But shit look at Dennis now all Stacy Adams and linend out
More blessings for Sandi and him more life
My parents never got it right
But God bless em both I think we all alike
We all wide awake late at night thinking on what to change
If we do get to do it twice in another life
Scared to go to sleep now
Cause being awake is what all my dreams were like
Back when the bar that I had set for myself was out of sight
Tell me how I went and did chinups on this shit when I cant see it
Pinups of Meagan Good and Pam Grier
Soul sisters inspired my old scriptures
Now that feelings gone like them old pictures
Mixin liquor got us both twisted words get so vicious
You just stare at me while you roll Swishers
Girl I love you but I dont miss ya
And no matter what year it is Im a   er
Go figure cold nigga stay in school man
Fuck the rap game its all lies and its all filthy
Two percent of us rich and the rest of these niggas all milk it
Got two of my niggas off with a not guilty
Gave back to the city and never said it if I didnt live it
But still they try and tell you Im not the realest
Like Im some privileged kid that never sat through a prison visit
Or like it was just handed to me tied with a ribbon
I never worked to get it
But really its you with all the drug dealer stories
Thats gotta stop though
You made a couple chops and now you think you Chapo
If you ask me though you aint lining the trunk with kilos
You bagging weed watching Pacino with all your niggas
Like This what we need to be on but you never went live
You middleman in this shit boy you was never them guys
I can tell cause I look most of you dead in your eyes
And youll be tryna sell that story for the rest of your lives
Cant show us where the cash is me I dont judge
Im just going off what the math is numbers inflated
They all look at me like What have you done for me lately
I like your older shit but wasnt in love with the latest
Aw baby stop debatin Im just a creative
My numbers out of this world
No wonder they got me feeling so alienated
You were the man on the moon
Now you just go through your phases
Life of the angry and famous
Rap like I know Im the greatest then give you tropical flavors
Still never been on hiatus
You stay xannd and perkd up
So when reality set in you dont gotta face it
Im down     in Vegas but winning life on a daily basis
It seems like nobody wants to stay in my good graces
Im like a real estate agent putting you all in your places
Look what happens soon as you talk to me crazy
Is you crazy

      I tell em they belong to me that goes on for forever
      And I think we just get closer when we not together
      You tell me that Im confusin
      More immature than Marques Houston
      Cuts too deep for a bandaid solution
      We too deep in this thing to never lose me
      LOLOL Im glad you find this shit amusin
      Heard a lot about me fore we started off
      I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras
      I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars
      Thats why shes always correctin me when my time is off
      And my house is the definition
      Of alcohol and weed addiction
      You got a different vision
      You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen
      Without runnin into one of my niggas
      Thats not the way we livin
      Too much goin on its just not realistic
      These days I dont talk bout them days like I miss em
      And you shouldnt miss em either we different people
      But every time we speakin
      Its like a lot of games bein played

      Playin mind games when you sayin things
      Playin mime games we both doin the same thing
      Slide on a late night
      You like to slide on a late night
      You send the are you here text without an invite
      Thats that shit that I dont like
      We both slide on a late night
      Do things in our off time
      We both yeah
      Made some mistakes pon road
      Yeah hows that for real
      You toyin with it like Happy Meal
        dots you thinkin of a reaction still

      We was still a secret couldnt come in through the front
      Girl I had your back when all you used to do was front
      Thats for sure though I made a career of reminiscin
      Time got a funny way of tickin things are so much different
      Ill admit it Ive admitted to a lot of things
      Act like you know it  them stories  the shade they throwin
      Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need
      And on my way to make this dough
      A lot of niggas cut the cheque so they can take this flow
      A lot of niggas cut the cheque so they can take this flow Ohhh ohhh

       Question is will I ever leave you
       The answer is no no no no no no
       Question is will I ever leave you
       The answer is no no no no no no
       Verse  
       Yeah you feel the pressure man I know the pressure
       And my wifey is a spice like Im David Beckham
       A lot of pent up aggression coming out of my section
       OVO on me while yall niggas was playing dressup
       And I know who gon take the fall with me
       They right here on call with me they all with me
       You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted
       They been saying its love but it isnt love is it
       Toast to the days when they wasnt out to get me
       I worked at JDs connections whenever Jason let me
        I was buying fitteds everyday
        Kennys caravan and trying not to catch a stray
       I dropped out right before I graduate
       Six credits left my mama had a saddest day
       Its only up from here I promise you just gotta wait
       And she took my word for it thats all I had to say
       Lately I just feel so out of character
       The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance
       Thoughts too deep to go work em out with a therapist
       I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison
       Im getting straight to the point with it
       Need yall to know that I never needed none of yall niggas
        being all buddy buddy with the opposition
       Its like a front of the plane nigga its all business
       But I havent flown with yall boys in a minute
       Verse  
       Look theyd rather run up on me than towards them goals
       My niggas still hit the club when its    below
       Who you think running this show
       You saw it in me at    years old
       The lingo start to sound like we talking in code
       I got a pure soul I dont do the hate
       You dont worry bout fitting in when you custom made
       Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change
       Now me and Kobe doing shots the night before the game
       Still drop    with liquor in my system
       Numbers going unlisted just to create some distance
       I might see you on and off but Ill never switch ya
       Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian
       Lamborghini got me feeling like Im Christian Bale
       And I never bare my morals for the ticket sales
       Tipping scales bars heavy like triple XL
       I never tag no one in Id rather get you myself
       Running through the   storming through the contracts
       Im possessed you can see it under the contacts
       They think I had the silver spoon but theyll get it soon
       I still got something left to prove since you left me room
       Paint a plan for the family debt we in the minus
       And like its going in a trunk I put it all behind us
       Where you tryna go I got it Ill take us wherever
       Im a staple in the game all my papers together
       And my life is on display like Truman
       They wanna pre the movements gotta start to make em sooner
       My exes made some of my favorite music
       I dated women from my favorite movies
       Karmas such a thing of beauty
       Id share more of my story but you wouldnt believe it
       Its far fetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters
       I keep it     like Im running a fever
       I might take a breather but I wont ever leave you
       If I was you I wouldnt like me either"

      Right
      Weston Road Flows I did this t for my  Renny
      Back when we couldnt buy pizza cause we were down to pennies
      Feel like we go back a century runnin the store for centuries
      Then bring it back to your brother man we had to respect it
      He was wavy doin mixtapes out of your bat
      He let us hit the  on occasion for entertainment
      Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
      We probably wouldve got in less trouble just goin with him
      Feel like I never say much but man theres a lot to know
      Feel like the difference between us really startin to show
      Im lookin at they first week numbers like what are those
      I mean you boys not even coming close
      I gave s like you a reason for celebration
      You number one and Im Eddie Murphy we tradin places
      Lookin in the mirror Im closer than I really appear
      Creepin like Chilli without the tender love and care
      No tender love and care and no love and affection
      I got a price on my head but theres a risk to collect it
      I might be here as a vessel to teach people the lesson
      Feel like they wanted me dead but couldnt pull it together
      
      Yeah but here we are and its a new semester
         the only one that know how I deal with the pressure
      A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings faded
      A lot of problems that cant be fixed with a conversation
      Your best day is my worst day I get green like Earth Day
      You treat me like Im born yesterday you forgot my birthday
      You dont be scorin perfect you dont be workin like how we be workin
      You platinum like rappers on Hersheys boy that t is worthless
      You get the message over and over like it was urgent
      And then act like you aint heard it when you see me in person
      The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in
      And did it with a purpose
      
      Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendps
      Nowadays they just shakin my hand to hide the tension
      A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned

Verse  
Okay okay I see whats happening here
Youre facetoface with greatness and its strange
You dont even know how you feel its adorable
Well its nice to see that humans never change
Open your eyes lets begin
Yes its really me its Maui breathe it in
I know its a lot the hair the bod
When youre staring at a demigod

Chorus
What can I say except youre welcome
For the tides the sun the sky
Hey its okay its okay youre welcome
Im just an ordinary demiguy

Verse  
Hey what has two thumbs and pulled up the sky
When you were waddling yay high This guy
When the nights got cold who stole you fire from down below
Youre looking at him yo
Oh also I lassoed the sun youre welcome
To stretch your days and bring you fun
Also I harnessed the breeze youre welcome
To fill your sails and shake your trees

Chorus
So what can I say except youre welcome
For the islands I pulled from the sea
Theres no need to pray its okay youre welcome
I guess its just my way of being me
Youre welcome youre welcome

Verse  
Well come to think of it
Kid honestly I can go on and on
I can explain every natural phenomenon
The tide the grass the ground
Oh that was Maui just messing around
I killed an eel I buried its guts
Sprouted a tree now youve got coconuts
Whats the lesson What is the takeaway
Dont mess with Maui when hes on the breakaway
And the tapestry here in my skin
Is a map of the victories I win
Look where Ive been I make everything happen
Look at that mean mini Maui just tippity tapping
Ha ha ha ha ha ha hey

Chorus
Well anyway let me say youre welcome
For the wonderful world you know
Hey its okay its okay youre welcome
Well come to think of it I gotta go
Hey its your day to say youre welcome
Cause Im gonna need that boat
Im sailing away away youre welcome
Cause Maui can do everything but float
Youre welcome youre welcome

And thank you

      When I was six years old
      I broke my leg
      And I was running from my brother and his friends
      And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
      I was younger then
      Take me back to when
      I found my heart and broke it here
      Made my friends and lost them through the years
      And Ive not seen the roaring fields in so long
      I know Ive grown
      I cant wait to go home
      Im on my way
      Driving at    down those
      Country lanes
      Singing to Tiny Dancer
      And I miss the way you made me feel
      Its real we watched the sunset
      Over the castle on the hill
      
      Fifteen years old
      And smoking handrolled cigarettes
      Running from the law through the backfields
      And getting drunk with my friends
      Had my first kiss on a Friday night
      I dont reckon that I did it right
      But I was younger then
      Take me back to when
      We found weekend jobs when we got paid
      Wed buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
      Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long
      Oh how weve grown
      I cant wait to go home
      Im on my way
      Driving at    down those
      Country lanes
      Singing to Tiny Dancer
      And I miss the way you made me feel
      Its real we watched the sunset
      Over the castle on the hill
      Over the castle on the hill
      Over the castle on the hill
      
      One friend left to sell clothes
      One works down by the coast
      One had two kids but lives alone
      Ones brother overdosed
      Ones already on his second wife
      Ones just barely getting by
      But these people raised me
      And I cant wait to go home
      And Im on my way
      I still remember these old
      Country lanes
      When we did not know the answers
      And I miss the way you made me feel
      Its real we watched the sunset

Verse  
When your legs dont work like they used to before
And I cant sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
And darling I will be loving you till were seventy
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at twentythree
And Im thinking bout how

PreChorus  
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well me I fall in love with you every single day
I just wanna tell you I am

Chorus
So honey now take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart Im thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

Verse  
When my hairs all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds dont remember my name
When my hands dont play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
Cause honey your soul could never grow old its evergreen
And baby your smiles forever in my mind and memory
And Im thinking bout how

PreChorus  
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe its all part of a plan
Well Ill just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that youll understand

Chorus
That baby now take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart Im thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

Chorus
So baby now take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling place your head on my beating heart Im thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh baby we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are

       You meet and neither one of you even know what hit em
       Got that warm fuzzy feeling
       Yeah them those chills you used to get em
       Now youre getting ing sick of looking at him
       You swore youd never hit him never do nothing to hurt him
       Now youre in each others face spewing venom in your words when you spit them
       You push pull each others hair scratch claw hit him
       Throw him down pin him
       So lost in the moments when youre in them
       Its a race thats the culprit controls your boat
       So they say youre best to go your separate ways
       Guess if they dont know you cus today that was yesterday
       Yesterday is over its a different day
       Sound like broken records playing over but you promised her
       Next time you show restraint
       You dont get another chance
       Life is no Nintendo game
       But you lied again
       Now you get to watch her leave out the window
       I guess thats why they call it window pain
       Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
       But thats alright because I like the way it hurts
       Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
       But thats alright because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie
       Now I know he said things hit things that we didnt mean
       And we fall back into the same patterns same routine
       But your tempers just as bad as mine is
       Youre the same as me
       But when it comes to love youre just as blinded
       Baby please come back
       It wasnt you baby it was me
       Maybe our relationship wasnt as crazy as it seemed
       Maybe thats what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
       All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
       Come inside pick up your bags off the sidewalk
       Dont you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
       I told you this is my fault
       Look me in the eye ball
       Next time Im pissed I lay my fist at the drywall
       Next time There wont be no next time
       I apologize even though I know its lies
       Im tired of the games I just want her back
       I know Im a liar
       If she ever tries to ing leave again
       Ima tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
       Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
       But thats alright because I like the way it hurts
       Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
       But thats alright because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie
       I love the way you lie"

      I travel through your mind until you spine like siren drills
      Im sliming grills of roaches with sprayed on disinfectants
      With some ex rappers till their spinal column disconnects
      We disinfect then check the monologue turn your system up
      Twist them up and indulge in the marijuana smoke
      This is the season for noise pollution contamination
      Examination of more cartoons than animation
      My lamination of narration
      Hits a snare and bass of track  up rapper interrogation
      When I declare invasion there aint no time to be stare and gazing
      I turn the stage into a barren wasteland
      Im Infinite
      
      You heard of hell well I was sent from it
      I went to its surface and sentenced for murdering instruments
      Now Im trying to repent from it
      But when I hear the beat Im tempted to make another attempt at it
      Im Infinite
      
      Bust it I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense of your elite defense
      I got to meet the fence fruit was stompin at your feet to rinse
      I greet intensive ladies I spoil all your fans
      I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil bands
      My coil hands around this microphone lethal
      One thought in my cerebral is deeper then a Jeep full of people
      MCs are feeble I came to cause some pandemonium
      Battle a band of phony MCs and stand the only one
      Imitator Intimidator Stimulator Simulator of data Eliminator
      Theres never been a greater since the burial of Jesus
       around and catch all of the venereal diseases
      My thesis will smash a stereo to pieces
      My accapella releases plastic masterpieces through telekinesis
      And eases you mentally gently sentimentally instrumentally
      With entity dementedly meant to be Infinite

      Man I got evidence Im never dense and I been clever ever since
      My residence was hesitant to do some t that represents the MO
      So Im assuming all responsibility
      Cause theres a monster will in me that always wants to kill MCs
      Mic messaler slamming like a wrestler
      Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler
      No one is speacialer My skill is intergalactical
      I get cynical at a fool then I send a crew back to school
      I never packed a tool or acted cool it wasnt practical
      Id rather led a tactful tractical track for your fancy
      In fact I cant see or cant imagine
      A man who aint a lover of beats or a fan of scratching
      This is for my family the kid who had a cameo on my last jam
      Plus the man who never had a plan B
      Be all you can be cause once you make an instant hit
      Im tense to be tempted when I see the sins my friends commit
      Im Infinite
      
      You heard of hell well I was sent from it

      And now hes dear and so unsure

      She glanced this way I thought I saw
      And when we touched she didnt shudder at my paw
      No it cant be Ill just ignore
      But then shes never looked at me that way before
      
      New and a bit alarming
      Whod have ever thought that this could be
      True that hes no Prince Charming
      But theres something in him that I simply didnt see

      If I could kill a word and watch it die
      Id poison never shoot goodbye
      And beat regret when I felt I had the nerve
      Yeah Id pound fear into a pile of sand
      Choke lonely out with my bare hands
      And Id hang hate so that it cant be heard
      If I could only kill a word
      Yeah Id take brokenness out back
      And break heartbreak stand there and laugh
      Right in its face while shootin it the bird
      Id put upset down in its place
      Id squeeze the life out of disgrace
      Lay over under six cold feet of dirt
      If I could only kill a word
      Give me sticks give me stones
      Bend my body break my bones
      Use staff and rod to turn me black and blue
      Cause you cant unhear you cant unsay
      But if were up to me to change
      Id turn lies and hate to love and truth
      If I could only kill a word
      Id knock out temptations teeth
      Id sever evil and let it bleed
      Light up wicked stand and watch it burn
      Id take vice and Id take vile
      And tie em up there with hostile
      Hang em high and leave em for the birds

      So give me sticks give me stones

       Since you turned the tables on me
       Ive been steady and learnin lonely
       Keepin this turntable spinnin
       Everything from Jones to Jennings
       Slowly plannin my survival
       In a threefoot stack of vinyl
       Since you had to walk on outta here
       Ive been havin a record year
       I bet you thought before you left
       Id just sit in silence by myself
       Turn this house into a jail
       Dyin slow in a livin hell
       But loves got a funny way of keepin score
       And your leavin lit up my scoreboard
       I usually make it through side a sober
       All bets are off when I flip her over
       One bourbon one scotch one beer
       Im havin a record year
       Quarter notes and Hanks half time
       Are poundin on this heart of mine
       Song to song I pass my time
       With these speakers on ten
       Your goodandgone keeps me up all night

       Im countin on a needle to save me
       I drop it in the groove
       And we go round and round
       And down in a spiral
       I guess I really oughta call and thank you
       I rediscovered Red Headed Stranger
       Got down with old James Brown
       And found New Grass Revival
       If you find your way back I owe you a beer

Intro
Mmm dadadadadadada

Verse  
Every day when I wake up
Tryna read my fortune on the bottom of my coffee cup
But it seems like I never finish
Its always half full or is it half empty
Maybe its my own superstition or a kind of self protection
If it all looks bad why would I wanna look ahead
Oh oh oh still sittin here
Just watching the sun go down down down down down

Chorus
Life goes on with or without you
Its up to you what youre gonna do
You could go or you could stay
Who cares anyway
Life goes on with or without you
Damn it baby what youre gonna do
You could go or you could stay
But who cares anyway
Haha yeah who really cares

Verse  
Every conversation gets me high on motivation
Gets me craving of your own familiar situation yeah
Reach the unreachable achieve the unbelievable
In the midst of all the madness remember lifes beautiful
Still Im feeling restless thinking I should rest less
Work more play hard ready for the encore
Is this the kinda life I really wanna live for two times
In my heart I know less is more more
More more more more more

Chorus
Life goes on with or without you
Its up to you what youre gonna do
You could go or you could stay
Who cares anyway
Life goes on with or without you
Damn it baby what youre gonna do
You could go or you could stay
But who cares anyway

Bridge
Starting to think its out of my hands
Is it all gonna be worth it in the end
Cause its safe here in my comfort zone
Never stray too far from home yeah yeah yeah
But then again this way Ill never know never know
Maybe I should go

Verse  
Go crazy go insane go for everything
Get the money dollar bills in your wallet say kaching
Sign the dealy make a mili sound famili uh
The urgency is sounding the drilly for the mamilli uh
And then they really talk in Braille actin chilly
They got me feelin like an achilles silly silly I mean really
Really really Really really though
Really really really though
Feel the vibration of the higher ground
Love always leads to the highest sound
Many conversations people makin speculations
As to my procrastination due to my revelations
And then they get fugazi
You call yourself a rider
You need to speed your loyalty up like Bugatti
Baby dont underestimate my underdog mentality
We bout to race ahead ambition on Ferrari

Chorus
Life goes on with or without you
Its up to you what youre gonna do
You could go or you could stay
Who cares anyway
Life goes on with or without you
Damn it baby what youre gonna do
You could go or you could stay
But who cares anyway
Who cares anyway

Outro

      It started from nothing
      I had no chance to prepare
      I couldnt see you coming
      It started from nothing
      I could hate you now
      Its quite alright to hate me now
      When we both know that deep down
      The feeling still deep down is good
      In the halls of your hotel
      Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
      How much I meant tomeant is sincere back then
      We had time to kill back then
      You aint a kid no more
      Well never be those kids again
      Its not the same ivorys illegal
      Dont you remember
      I broke your heart last week
      Youll probably feel better by the weekend
      Still remember had you going crazy
      Screaming my name
      The feeling deep down is good
      I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
      It started from nothing
      I had no chance to prepare
      I couldnt see you coming
      It started from nothing
      I could hate you now
      Its alright to hate me now
      When we both know that deep down
      The feeling still deep down is good
      All the things I didnt mean to say
      I didnt mean to do
      There were things you didnt need to say
      You didnt need toneed to
      I could dream all night
      Dream all night
      I could drive all night

       Been more good than bad years

Oh its just me myself and I
Solo ride until I die
Cause I got me for life
yeah
Oh I dont need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold
I got that fire in my soul

VERSE

And this the new Solo Squad
Three names but only one person I know that this shit does seem kinda odd
Like really could there still be a facade

With both hands I pray to God
Hoping that my heart forever is broken
I know that Im chosen babe are you joking
You cash in emotions like they were some tokens games

Oh no hes zoning
Look in the mirror and see my opponent
Stripped of my love OD on serotonin
Im riding my own wave feel like Im boating waves

For the gram I be posing
Italian at heart so my thoughts do be roaming
Me myself and I steady be flowing
Feeling so high almost like I am floating

HOOK

VERSE  

So this just the way it go
Put trust in too many people too easily
No room for secrecy if you deceiving me hey
I be Young Metro I dont trust you

Booming up off this beat
Yeah shoutout to Gerald E
Maybe you one day you will sign us three
When you hear this and cannot deny the heat flames

And I spit this so litfully
Only way for us to turn ups illegally
And I blame myself and me
Kicks be so shady I guess I move sneakily

Yeah on a wave like a frequency
Keep scissors in a holster cause I frequently
Cut down these ride alongs just like a Christmas tree
Decorate all you as I go make history

HOOK

VERSE  

Im just chasing my dreams
Trying to be someone that they never seen
Doing it solo with me on my team
Myself and I both know that we kings

And all three are chasing the rings
Feeling like Drizzy just needing big things
Dont need nobody cause bodies are fiends
Im feeling like Kobe cause I run my team

       As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
       As the music dies
       Something in your eyes
       Calls to mind a silver screen
       And all its sad goodbyes
       Im never gonna dance again
       Guilty feet have got no rhythm
       Though its easy to pretend
       I know youre not a fool
       I should have known better than to cheat a friend
       And waste a chance that Id been given
       So Im never gonna dance again
       The way I danced with you
       Time can never mend
       The careless whisper of a good friend
       To the heart and mind
       Ignorance is kind
       Theres no comfort in the truth
       Pain is all youll find
       Im never gonna dance again
       Guilty feet have got no rhythm

       Tonight the music seems so loud
       I wish that we could lose this crowd
       Maybe its better this way
       Wed hurt each other with the things we want to say
       We could have been so good together
       We could have lived this dance forever
       But now whos gonna dance with me
       Please stay
       Im never gonna dance again
       Guilty feet have got no rhythm
       Though its easy to pretend
       I know youre not a fool
       I should have known better than to cheat a friend
       And waste a chance that Id been given
       So Im never gonna dance again
       The way I danced with you
       Now that youre gone
       Was what I did so wrong
       So wrong that you had to leave me alone"

Verse  
Well I guess it would be nice if I could touch your body
I know not everybody has got a body like you
But I gotta think twice before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play because I played them too

PreChorus
Oh but I need some time off from that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
Oh when that love comes down without devotion
Well it takes a strong man baby
But Im showin you the door

Chorus
Cause I gotta have faith
I gotta have faith
Because I gotta have faith faith faith
I got to have faith faith faith

Verse  
Baby I know youre askin me to stay
Say Please please please dont go away
You say Im givin you the blues
Maybe huh you mean every word you say
Cant help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to loverboy rules

PreChorus  
Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
Oh baby I reconsider my foolish notion
Well I need someone to hold me but Ill wait for somethin more

Chorus
Yes I gotta have faith
Ooh I gotta have faith
Because I gotta have faith faith faith
I gotta have faith faith faith

Ill just have to wait

       when love and trust are gone
       i guess this is moving on

Verse   GEazy
Woah lets go
But Im Gerald and I can always have just what I want
Shes that baddest I would love to flaunt
Take her shopping you know Yves Saint Laurent
But nope she aint with it though
All because she got her own dough
Boss bossed if you dont know
She could never ever be a broke ho

Verse   Grace
You dont own me
Im not just one of your many toys
You dont own me
Dont say I cant go with other boys

Chorus Grace
Dont tell me what to do
And dont tell me what to say
Please when I go out with you

Verse   Grace
You dont own me
Dont try to change me in any way
You dont own me
Dont tie me down cause Id never stay

Chorus Grace
Dont tell me what to do
And dont tell me what to say
Please when I go out with you

Verse   GEazy
Really though honestly
I get bored of basic bitches
Shes the baddest straight up vicious texting her and asking her
If shes alone and if shed sent some pictures she said no what
Well goddamn she said come over and see it for yourself
Never asking for your help independent woman
She aint for the shelf
No shes the one
Smoke with her till the weed is gone
Stayin up until we see the sun
Baddest ever I swear she do it better than Ive ever seen it done
Never borrow she aint ever loan
Thats when she told me she aint never ever ever ever gonna be owned

Verse   Grace
I dont tell you what to say
I dont tell you what to do
So just let me be myself
Thats all I ask of you

To live my life the way I want
To say and do whatever I please

You dont own me

      Some things were never said
      We were on one endless road
      But I had a wandering heart
      I said we were opposite lovers
      Said it from the beginning
      You kept trying to prove me wrong
      Said youd always see it through
      And I know that I ran you down
      So you ran away with your heart
      But just know that I want you back
      Just know that I want you back
      Just know that I want you
      Ill take the fall and the fault in us

      And it may never be enough
      But dont take it out on me now
      Cause I blame it all on myself
      And I had a fear of forgiveness
      Said it from the beginning
      I was too proud to say I was wrong
      Said youd always see me through
      All that time is gone no more fearing control
      Im ready for the both of us now

Covered in kudzu vines

       IntroFor your eyes only for your eyes only
       for your eyes
       Verse  Hey
       s be dying on the daily
       It seems my dreams faded for far too long the consequences deadly
       Cant visualize myself as nothing but a criminal
       Control the block serving up rocks and stay subliminal
       Cause young s is hard headed they letting off
       Full of adrenaline ignorant to what death can cause
       Aint no coming back family dressed in black
       Plus its hot now the cops outside its hard to flip a pack
       And my daughter gotta eat her mama be stressing me
       Like I aint the one who put them Jays on her feet
       Like I aint out in the field like that
       I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back
       Despite the charges back to the wall I fight regardless Screaming  the law my life is lawless
       Thats what you call it
       Aint got to be no psychic to see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
       This is hell and I dont mean that hyperbolic
       I try to find employment even if the swiper chargeless
       But these felonies be making life the hardest
       Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
       Or run up on your yard snatch your daughter bike and pawn it
       Thats why I write this sonnet
       If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break
       Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it
       Let her know my life is on it
       For your eyes
       Let her know my life is on
       For your eyes only
       HookFor your eyes do you understand
       For your eyes do you understand me
       For your eyes do you understand
       For your eyes do you understand me
       For your eyes do you understand
       For your eyes do you understand me
       For your eyes do you understand
       For your eyes do you understand me
       Verse  Youre probably grown now so this songll hit you
       If youre hearing this unfortunately means that Im no longer with you
       In the physical not even sure if I believe in God
       But because you still alive
       He got me praying that the spiritual is real
       So I can be a part of you still my pops was killed too
       So I know how part of you feels
       Maybe you hate me maybe you miss me maybe you spite me
       Life goes in cycles maybe youll date a  just like me
       I hope not Im tired of  spots
       And fiends that smoke rocks Ive seen far too many s hopes rot
       Im writing this because me and the devil had a dance
       Now I see death around the corner apologizing in advance
       Dont know if I ever had a chance
       At a glance Im a failure addicted to pung paraphernalia
       But Daddy had dreams once my eyes had a gleam once
       Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
       My Pops shot up drug related
       Mama addicted
       So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
       Blood was staining the concrete
       Older s I loved talked like they was above maintaining a time sheet
       That slow money picked up the family business
       By the age of thirteen six years later was handed sentence
       Round the same time is when you came in this world
       Me and your mama thinking what the  we naming this girl
       I told her Nina the prettiest name that I could think of
       For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen
       I was nineteen took me two felonies to see the trap this crooked ass system set for me
       And now I fear its too late for me to ever be the one that set examples that was never set for me
       Im living fast but not fast enough cause karma keeps on catching up to me
       And if my past becomes the death of me I hope you understand
       HookFor your eyes do you understand
       For your eyes do you understand me
       For your eyes do you understand
       For your eyes do you understand me
       For your eyes do you understand
       For your eyes do you understand me
       For your eyes do you understand
       For your eyes do you understand me
       Verse  Its several ways I couldve went out too many to count
       Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout
       Was it the young s blasting frustrated cause the cash running out
       s dont know how to act in a drought
       See baby girl I realized my definition of a real  was skewed
       My views misshaped by new mixtapes
       That confirmed the t I learned in the streets was true
       That real s dont speak when they beef with you
       They just pull up on your street let the heat at you
       And if a real  hungry he gon eat your food
       I was a fool spent all my time ducking school ducking cops
       Ducking rules hugging blocks that dont love you
       I pray you find a  with goals and point of views
       Much broader than the corner if not its gon corner you
       Into a box where your son dont even know his pops
       And the cyclical nature of doing time continues
       My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
       and see your father face while hearing bout tragedy on news
       I got the strangest feeling your Daddy gonna lose his life soon
       And sadly if youre listening now it must mean its true
       But maybe theres a chance that its not
       And this album remains locked in a hard drive like valuable jewels
       And I can teach you this in person like Im teaching you to tie your own shoes
       I love you and I hope to God I dont lose you
       For your eyes only
       HookFor your eyes
       For your eyes only
       For your eyes
       For your eyes only
       For your eyes do you understand
       Verse  One day your daddy called me told me he had a funny feeling
       What hed been dealing with lately he wasnt telling
       I tried to pick his brains still he wasnt revealing
       But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice and it was chilling
       He said Jermaine I knew you since we was children I never asked for nothing
       When times was hard I never had discussions with you begging you to help me
       I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
       I know you tried to steer me way from that t
       But that t was in my blood you know my life
       I know your Momma  send my love
       In case I never get a chance to speak again
       I wont forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib
       Thats the way I wished my family lived
       But my granny crib was in the jects
       I had to interject like  what you talking bout  is you getting at
       He said Listen I got no time to dive into descriptions
       But Ive been having premonitions just call it visions from the other side
       I got a feeling I wont see tomorrow like the time Im living on is borrowed
       With that said the only thing Im proud to say I was a father
       Write my story down and if I pass go play it for my daughter when she ready
       And so Im leaving you this record for your eyes only dont you ever scratch or disrespect it
       This perspective is a real one another lost Ville son
       I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
       Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
       That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
       Sometimes I think this segregation wouldve done us better
       Although I know that means I would never be brought into this world
       cuz my daddy was so thrilled when he found him a white girl
       to take back to Jonesborough withlil Zach and Cole World barely one years old
       now its thirty years later making sure the storys told
       Girl your daddy was a real  not cos he was cold
       Not because he was the first to get some  twelve years old
       Not because he used to come through in the Caddy on some vogues
       Not because he went from bagging up them grams to serving Os
       Nah your daddy was a real  not cos he was hard
       Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars
       Not because he screamed  the law although that was true
       Your daddy was a real  cuz he loved you
       For your eyes only

      Yeah life is a balance
      You lose your grip you can slip into an abyss
      No doubt you see these s trippin
      Ego in charge of every move hes a star
      And we cant look away
      Due to the days that he caught our hearts
      Hes fallin apart but we deny it
      Justifying that halfass t he dropped we always buy it
      When he tell us he a genius but its clearer lately
      Its been hard for him to look into the mirror lately
      There was a time when this  was my hero maybe
      Thats the reason why his fall from grace is hard to take
      Cause I believed him when he said his t was purer and he
      
      The type of  swear he real but all around hims fake
      The women the riders you know the yes men
      Nobody with the  to say somethin to contest him
      So he grows out of control
      Into the person that he truly was all along
      Its startin to show Damn wonder what happened
      Maybe its my fault for idolizing s
      Based off the words they be rappin
      But come to find out these s dont even write they t
      Hear some new style bubblin up then they bite the t
      Damn thats what I get for lyin to myself

      I got a homie he a rapper and he wanna win bad
      He want the fame the acclaim the respect thats been had
      By all the legends so every time I see him he stressin
      Talkin bout s dont  with him the t is depressin
      And I know he so bitter he cant see his own blessings
      Goddamn  you too blind to see you got fans 
      And a platform to make a classic rap song
      To change a s life but you too anxious livin life
      Always worried bout the critics who aint ever  did it
      I write whats in my heart dont give a  who  with it
      But in a sense I can relate the need to be great
      Turns into an obsession and keeps a  up late
      Writin words hopin people observe the dedication
      That stirs in you constantly but intentions get blurred
      Do I do it for the love of the music or is there more to me
      Do I want these s to worp me False prophets

      These rappers insecure
      They talk about being a man so much
      I finally understand that they aint even sure
      Bout who they are and why they do this
      Guess Im included in that category
      As a  who done had the glory
      My highest moments come from tellin all the saddest stories
      Ive seen in my life I be fiendin to write
      Songs that raise the hair on my arms
      My lowest moments came from tryin too hard
      To impress some s that couldnt care if Im on
      Therefore from here on out my hair grow out
      I care nothin bout opinions
      I wanna give hope like the fountains you throw pennies in
      Hit the store take your diss make your wish
      This is dedicated to the ones
      Who listen to me on some faithful t
      Im on some thankful t
      But the real god is in you not the music you coppin
      I hear my old t and I know I can top it false prophets

I wanna cry
And I aint even tryna fight it
Dont wanna die Dont wanna die no more
Cause now youre here and I just wanna be
Right by your side
On any night that you be crying baby
Ill dry your eyes

Verse
Every time you go to sleep you look like you in Heaven
Plus the head game is stronger than a few Excedrin
You shine just like the patent leather on my new   s
You read me like a book like Im the Bible you the Reverend
Yeah I wanna tell the truth to you
I wanna talk about my days as a youth to you
Exposing you to all my demons and the reasons Im this way
I would like to paint a picture but itll take more than a day
It would take more than some years to get all over all my fears
Preventing me from letting you see all of me perfectly clear
The same wall thats stopping me from letting go and shedding tears
From the lack of having father and the passing of my peers
While Im too scared to expose myself
It turns out you know me better than I know myself
Better than I know myself
Well how bout that

And the need to purchase shit from corporations
That make a killin because they feed
On the wallets of the poor who be knockin on they door
Every Black Friday just to get some shit they cant afford
Even with the discount write a check that shit bounce
But as long as we got credit it dont matter the amount

Whats that smell Wheres your diaper shit here
Lay on your back dont pee right now

One day when you gon want to get your way

      Tell me where have you gone
      Do you remember me
      We were only fifteen
      And I I remember the chorus
      They were singing it for us
      You were my September song
      Tell me where have you gone
      Do you remember me
      We were only fifteen
      
      Sometimes I think that I see your
      Face in the strangest of places
      Down on the underground station passing by
      I get a mad sense of danger
      Feel like my heart couldnt take it
      Cause if we met wed be strangers
      You and I
      
      Still I play that mixtape every weekend
      Got it repeating
      Got it repeating
      You were my September song
      Summer lasted too long
      Time moves so slowly
      When youre only fifteen
      You were my September song
      Tell me where have you gone
      Do you remember me
      We were only fifteen
      And I I I remember the chorus
      They were singing it for us
      I hear that September song
      That Im singing along
      Thinking about you and me
      Oh what a melody
      
      And as the years go by
      You will still be my be my
      September song
      You are my
      September song
      
      You were my September song

      And every town and every place
      Theres a boy whos tryin to take a chance and dance
      And find a way to run away with her heart
      In the back of an old Ford truck
      In the bar just lookin for luck
      In a pair of oh my blue eyes
      Let them fireworks start
      That American country love song
      Aint never gonna quit playin on and on and on
      Well its Chris loves Jenny on a license plate

      So I can turn it up and maybe turn her on

What can I say
Now that Im not the fire in the cold
Now that Im not the hand that you hold
As youre walking away

Cause Ill worry about you the whole night
Dont repeat my mistakes
I wont sleep til youre safe inside
If youre home I just hope that youre sober
Is it time to let go now youre older
Dont leave me this way
I wont sleep til youre safe inside

Everyone has to find their own way
And Im sure things will work out okay
I wish that was the truth
All we know is the sun will rise
Thank your lucky stars that youre alive
Its a beautiful life

      You made me feel as though
      I was enough
      We danced the night away
      We drank too much
      I held your hair back when
      You were throwing up
      
      Then you smiled over your shoulder
      For a minute I was stone cold sober
      I pulled you closer to my chest
      And you asked me to stay over
      I said I already told ya
      I think that you should get some rest

      I know I needed you

      Until were grey and old

      Just say you wont let go
      
      I wake you up with some breakfast in bed
      Ill bring you coffee
      With a kiss on your head
      And Ill take the kids to school
      Wave them goodbye
      And Ill thank my lucky stars for that night

       Everything Ive imagined
       Hearts without any hate
       Crying for change
       Causing a chain reaction
       Those who hate us and fear us can not keep us down
       Cause we hear in our heartbeat a beautiful sound

       Im dancing face to face with a stranger
       A moment of grace you know that youre safe and they just
       Drop the beat the moment you most needed it
       You came in as a question until the music completed it
       Me and you in the universe moving in unison coming in hot
       But in the grand scheme what do we got
       What we got is love even when the sinners hate us
       We can not let em diminish or intimidate us
       We sing out we got the rhythm and the truth on our side
       We cut through the divide and we do it with pride
       Wake up wake up wake up
       A generation of innovators unable to patiently wait for change
       Cause change is what theyve been afraid of
       Their malevolence can wait raise the level of debate

       Cannot be killed or swept aside

      I could break down and cry
      Laugh it off and deny
      Draw lines in the sand
      And count on both hands
      All the reasons why
      This just wont work
      Itll be nothing but hurt
      I can swear that I dont
      And maybe one day I wont
      But for how hard Ive tried
      I cant unlove you
      My heart cant unbreak
      I cant unfeel how it felt
      But feel so much myself
      My whole body ached
      And I cant unknow this
      Lord I wish I knew how
      But I cant unlove you
      So come love me for now
      If I were   
      I know just what Id do
      I would have already kissed
      Till I was drunk on your lips
      A thousand times too few
      But we have other lives
      And we know it aint right
      This is going nowhere
      If Im with you I dont care
      Take me nowhere tonight
      They call it fire
      But it feels just like drowning
      Well the weight of my burning desire
      Closing in all around me
      I wasnt lost until you found me
      And I cant unlove you
      My heart cant unbreak
      I cant unfeel how it felt
      But feel so much myself
      My whole body ached
      And I cant unknow this
      Lord I wish I knew how
      But I cant unlove you
      So come love me for now
      I cant unlove you
      So come love me for now"

      Get a little tongue tied

      That time before the turned the corner

      Till we start to feel the west

      You could see it from the edge of town
      Honey baby wonder how it feel now
      Somehow I cant believe
      that it could feel like the four but

      The nights are getting crisp

Rambling on foot in the spring of my life and the summer of the year I came one afternoon to a point which gave me the choice of three directions Straight before me the main road extended its dusty length to Boston on the left a branch went toward the sea and would have lengthened my journey a trifle of twenty or thirty miles while by the righthand path I might have gone over hills and lakes to Canada visiting in my way the celebrated town of Stamford On a level spot of grass at the foot of the guidepost appeared an object which though locomotive on a different principle reminded me of Gullivers portable mansion among the Brobdignags It was a huge covered wagonor more properly a small house on wheelswith a door on one side and a window shaded by green blinds on the other Two horses munching provender out of the baskets which muzzled them were fastened near the vehicle A delectable sound of music proceeded from the interior and I immediately conjectured that this was some itinerant show halting at the confluence of the roads to intercept such idle travellers as myself A shower had long been climbing up the western sky and now hung so blackly over my onward path that it was a point of wisdom to seek shelter here

Halloo Who stands guard here Is the doorkeeper asleep cried I approaching a ladder of two or three steps which was let down from the wagon

The music ceased at my summons and there appeared at the door not the sort of figure that I had mentally assigned to the wandering showman but a most respectable old personage whom I was sorry to have addressed in so free a style He wore a snuffcolored coat and smallclothes with white topboots and exhibited the mild dignity of aspect and manner which may often be noticed in aged schoolmasters and sometimes in deacons selectmen or other potentates of that kind A small piece of silver was my passport within his premises where I found only one other person hereafter to be described

This is a dull day for business said the old gentleman as he ushered me in but I merely tarry here to refresh the cattle being bound for the campmeeting at Stamford

Perhaps the movable scene of this narrative is still peregrinating New England and may enable the reader to test the accuracy of my description The spectaclefor I will not use the unworthy term of puppetshowconsisted of a multitude of little people assembled on a miniature stage Among them were artisans of every kind in the attitudes of their toil and a group of fair ladies and gay gentlemen standing ready for the dance a company of footsoldiers formed a line across the stage looking stern grim and terrible enough to make it a pleasant consideration that they were but three inches high and conspicuous above the whole was seen a Merry Andrew in the pointed cap and motley coat of his profession All the inhabitants of this mimic world were motionless like the figures in a picture or like that people who one moment were alive in the midst of their business and delights and the next were transformed to statues preserving an eternal semblance of labor that was ended and pleasure that could be felt no more Anon however the old gentleman turned the handle of a barrelorgan the first note of which produced a most enlivening effect upon the figures and awoke them all to their proper occupations and amusements By the selfsame impulse the tailor plied his needle the blacksmiths hammer descended upon the anvil and the dancers whirled away on feathery tiptoes the company of soldiers broke into platoons retreated from the stage and were succeeded by a troop of horse who came prancing onward with such a sound of trumpets and trampling of hoofs as might have startled Don Quixote himself while an old toper of inveterate illhabits uplifted his black bottle and took off a hearty swig Meantime the Merry Andrew began to caper and turn somersets shaking his sides nodding his head and winking his eyes in as lifelike a manner as if he were ridiculing the nonsense of all human affairs and making fun of the whole multitude beneath him At length the old magician for I compared the showman to Prospero entertaining his guests with a masque of shadows paused that I might give utterance to my wonder

What an admirable piece of work is this exclaimed I lifting up my hands in astonishment

Indeed I liked the spectacle and was tickled with the old mans gravity as he presided at it for I had none of that foolish wisdom which reproves every occupation that is not useful in this world of vanities If there be a faculty which I possess more perfectly than most men it is that of throwing myself mentally into situations foreign to my own and detecting with a cheerful eye the desirable circumstances of each I could have envied the life of this grayheaded showman spent as it had been in a course of safe and pleasurable adventure in driving his huge vehicle sometimes through the sands of Cape Cod and sometimes over the rough forestroads of the north and east and halting now on the green before a village meetinghouse and now in a paved square of the metropolis How often must his heart have been gladdened by the delight of children as they viewed these animated figures or his pride indulged by haranguing learnedly to grown men on the mechanical powers which produced such wonderful effects or his gallantry brought into playfor this is an attribute which such grave men do not lackby the visits of pretty maidens And then with how fresh a feeling must he return at intervals to his own peculiar home I would I were assured of as happy a life as his thought I

Though the showmans wagon might have accommodated fifteen or twenty spectators it now contained only himself and me and a third person at whom I threw a glance on entering He was a neat and trim young man of two or three and twenty his drab hat and green frockcoat with velvet collar were smart though no longer new while a pair of green spectacles that seemed needless to his brisk little eyes gave him something of a scholarlike and literary air After allowing me a sufficient time to inspect the puppets he advanced with a bow and drew my attention to some books in a corner of the wagon These he forthwith began to extol with an amazing volubility of wellsounding words and an ingenuity of praise that won him my heart as being myself one of the most merciful of critics Indeed his stock required some considerable powers of commendation in the salesman There were several ancient friends of minethe novels of those happy days when my affections wavered between the Scottish Chiefs and Thomas Thumbbesides a few of later date whose merits had not been acknowledged by the public I was glad to find that dear little venerable volume the New England Primer looking as antique as ever though in its thousandth new edition a bundle of superannuated gilt picturebooks made such a child of me that partly for the glittering covers and partly for the fairytales within I bought the whole and an assortment of ballads and popular theatrical songs drew largely on my purse To balance these expenditures I meddled neither with sermons nor science nor morality though volumes of each were there nor with a Life of Franklin in the coarsest of paper but so showily bound that it was emblematical of the doctor himself in the courtdress which he refused to wear at Paris nor with Websters spellingbook nor some of Byrons minor poems nor half a dozen little Testaments at twentyfive cents each Thus far the collection might have been swept from some great bookstore or picked up at an evening auctionroom but there was one small bluecovered pamphlet which the pedler handed me with so peculiar an air that I purchased it immediately at his own price and then for the first time the thought struck me that I had spoken face to face with the veritable author of a printed book

The literaryman now evinced a great kindness for me and I ventured to inquire which way he was travelling

Oh said he I keep company with this old gentlemen here and we are moving now toward the campmeeting at Stamford

He then explained to me that for the present season he had rented a corner of the wagon as a bookstore which as he wittily observed was a true circulating library since there were few parts of the country where it had not gone its rounds I approved of the plan exceedingly and began to sum up within my mind the many uncommon felicities in the life of a bookpedler especially when his character resembled that of the individual before me At a high rate was to be reckoned the daily and hourly enjoyment of such interviews as the present in which he seized upon the admiration of a passing stranger and made him aware that a man of literary taste and even of literary achievement was travelling the country in a showmans wagon A more valuable yet not infrequent triumph might be won in his conversations with some elderly clergyman long vegetating in a rocky woody watery backsettlement of New England who as he recruited his library from the pedlers stock of sermons would exhort him to seek a college education and become the first scholar in his class Sweeter and prouder yet would be his sensations when talking poetry while he sold spellingbooks he should charm the mind and haply touch the heart of a fair country schoolmistress herself an unhonored poetess a wearer of blue stockings which none but himself took pains to look at But the scene of his completest glory would be when the wagon had halted for the night and his stock of books was transferred to some crowded barroom Then would he recommend to the multifarious company whether traveller from the city or teamster from the hills or neighboring squire or the landlord himself or his loutish hostler works suited to each particular taste and capacity proving all the while by acute criticism and profound remark that the lore in his books was even exceeded by that in his brain Thus happily would he traverse the land sometimes a herald before the march of Mind sometimes walking arm in arm with awful Literature and reaping everywhere a harvest of real and sensible popularity which the secluded bookworms by whose toil he lived could never hope for

If ever I meddle with literature thought I fixing myself in adamantine resolution it shall be as a travelling bookseller

Though it was still midafternoon the air had now grown dark about us and a few drops of rain came down upon the roof of our vehicle pattering like the feet of birds that had flown thither to rest A sound of pleasant voices made us listen and there soon appeared halfway up the ladder the pretty person of a young damsel whose rosy face was so cheerful that even amid the gloomy light it seemed as if the sunbeams were peeping under her bonnet We next saw the dark and handsome features of a young man who with easier gallantry than might have been expected in the heart of Yankeeland was assisting her into the wagon It became immediately evident to us when the two strangers stood within the door that they were of a profession kindred to those of my companions and I was delighted with the more than hospitablethe even paternalkindness of the old showmans manner as he welcomed them while the man of literature hastened to lead the merryeyed girl to a seat on the long bench

You are housed but just in time my young friends said the master of the wagon the sky would have been down upon you within five minutes

The young mans reply marked him as a foreignernot by any variation from the idiom and accent of good English but because he spoke with more caution and accuracy than if perfectly familiar with the language

We knew that a shower was hanging over us said he and consulted whether it were best to enter the house on the top of yonder hill but seeing your wagon in the road

We agreed to come hither interrupted the girl with a smile because we should be more at home in a wandering house like this

I meanwhile with many a wild and undetermined fantasy was narrowly inspecting these two doves that had flown into our ark The young man tall agile and athletic wore a mass of black shining curls clustering round a dark and vivacious countenance which if it had not greater expression was at least more active and attracted readier notice than the quiet faces of our countrymen At his first appearance he had been laden with a neat mahogany box of about two feet square but very light in proportion to its size which he had immediately unstrapped from his shoulders and deposited on the floor of the wagon

The girl had nearly as fair a complexion as our own beauties and a brighter one than most of them the lightness of her figure which seemed calculated to traverse the whole world without weariness suited well with the glowing cheerfulness of her face and her gay attire combining the rainbow hues of crimson green and a deep orange was as proper to her lightsome aspect as if she had been born in it This gay stranger was appropriately burdened with that mirthinspiring instrument the fiddle which her companion took from her hands and shortly began the process of tuning Neither of us the previous company of the wagon needed to inquire their trade for this could be no mystery to frequenters of brigademusters ordinations cattleshows commencements and other festal meetings in our sober land and there is a dear friend of mine who will smile when this page recalls to his memory a chivalrous deed performed by us in rescuing the showbox of such a couple from a mob of great doublefisted countrymen

Come said I to the damsel of gay attire shall we visit all the wonders of the world together

She understood the metaphor at once though indeed it would not much have troubled me if she had assented to the literal meaning of my words The mahogany box was placed in a proper position and I peeped in through its small round magnifyingwindow while the girl sat by my side and gave short descriptive sketches as one after another the pictures were unfolded to my view We visited togetherat least our imaginations didfull many a famous city in the streets of which I had long yearned to tread Once I remember we were in the harbor of Barcelona gazing townward next she bore me through the air to Sicily and bade me look up at blazing Ætna then we took wing to Venice and sat in a gondola beneath the arch of the Rialto and anon she set me down among the thronged spectators at the coronation of Napoleon But there was one sceneits locality she could not tellwhich charmed my attention longer than all those gorgeous palaces and churches because the fancy haunted me that I myself the preceding summer had beheld just such a humble meetinghouse in just such a pinesurrounded nook among our own green mountains All these pictures were tolerably executed though far inferior to the girls touches of description nor was it easy to comprehend how in so few sentences and these as I supposed in a language foreign to her she contrived to present an airy copy of each varied scene

When we had travelled through the vast extent of the mahogany box I looked into my guides face

Where are you going my pretty maid inquired I in the words of an old song

Ah said the gay damsel you might as well ask where the summer wind is going We are wanderers here and there and everywhere Wherever there is mirth our merry hearts are drawn to it Today indeed the people have told us of a great frolic and festival in these parts so perhaps we may be needed at what you call the campmeeting at Stamford

Then in my happy youth and while her pleasant voice yet sounded in my ears I sighed for none but myself I thought should have been her companion in a life which seemed to realize my own wild fancies cherished all through visionary boyhood to that hour To these two strangers the world was in its Golden Agenot that indeed it was less dark and sad than ever but because its weariness and sorrow had no community with their ethereal nature Wherever they might appear in their pilgrimage of bliss Youth would echo back their gladness carestricken Maturity would rest a moment from its toil and Age tottering among the graves would smile in withered joy for their sakes The lonely cot the narrow and gloomy street the sombre shade would catch a passing gleam like that now shining on ourselves as these bright spirits wandered by Blessed pair whose happy home was throughout all the earth I looked at my shoulders and thought them broad enough to sustain those pictured towns and mountains mine too was an elastic foot as tireless as the wing of the bird of Paradise mine was then an untroubled heart that would have gone singing on its delightful way

Oh maiden said I aloud why did you not come hither alone

While the merry girl and myself were busy with the showbox the unceasing rain had driven another wayfarer into the wagon He seemed pretty nearly of the old showmans age but much smaller leaner and more withered than he and less respectably clad in a patched suit of gray withal he had a thin shrewd countenance and a pair of diminutive gray eyes which peeped rather too keenly out of their puckered sockets This old fellow had been joking with the showman in a manner which intimated previous acquaintance but perceiving that the damsel and I had terminated our affairs he drew forth a folded document and presented it to me As I had anticipated it proved to be a circular written in a very fair and legible hand and signed by several distinguished gentlemen whom I had never heard of stating that the bearer had encountered every variety of misfortune and recommending him to the notice of all charitable people Previous disbursements had left me no more than a fivedollar bill out of which however I offered to make the beggar a donation provided he would give me change for it The object of my beneficence looked keenly in my face and discerned that I had none of that abominable spirit characteristic though it be of a fullblooded Yankee which takes pleasure in detecting every little harmless piece of knavery

Why perhaps said the ragged old mendicant if the bank is in good standing I cant say but I may have enough about me to change your bill

It is a bill of the Suffolk Bank said I and better than the specie

As the beggar had nothing to object he now produced a small buff leather bag tied up carefully with a shoestring When this was opened there appeared a very comfortable treasure of silver coins of all sorts and sizes and I even fancied that I saw gleaming among them the golden plumage of that rare bird in our currency the American eagle In this precious heap was my banknote deposited the rate of exchange being considerably against me

His wants being thus relieved the destitute man pulled out of his pocket an old pack of greasy cards which had probably contributed to fill the buff leather bag in more ways than one

Come said he I spy a rare fortune in your face and for twentyfive cents more Ill tell you what it is

I never refuse to take a glimpse into futurity so after shuffling the cards and when the fair damsel had cut them I dealt a portion to the prophetic beggar Like others of his profession before predicting the shadowy events that were moving on to meet me he gave proof of his preternatural science by describing scenes through which I had already passed

Here let me have credit for a sober fact When the old man had read a page in his book of fate he bent his keen gray eyes on mine and proceeded to relate in all its minute particulars what was then the most singular event of my life It was one which I had no purpose to disclose till the general unfolding of all secrets nor would it be a much stranger instance of inscrutable knowledge or fortunate conjecture if the beggar were to meet me in the street today and repeat word for word the page which I have here written

The fortuneteller after predicting a destiny which time seems loth to make good put up his cards secreted his treasurebag and began to converse with the other occupants of the wagon

Well old friend said the showman you have not yet told us which way your face is turned this afternoon

I am taking a trip northward this warm weather replied the conjurer across the Connecticut first and then up through Vermont and maybe into Canada before the fall But I must stop and see the breaking up of the campmeeting at Stamford

I began to think that all the vagrants in New England were converging to the campmeeting and had made this wagon their rendezvous by the way

The showman now proposed that when the shower was over they should pursue the road to Stamford together it being sometimes the policy of these people to form a sort of league and confederacy

And the young lady too observed the gallant bibliopolist bowing to her profoundly and this foreign gentleman as I understand are on a jaunt of pleasure to the same spot It would add incalculably to my own enjoyment and I presume to that of my colleague and his friend if they could be prevailed upon to join our party

This arrangement met with approbation on all hands nor were any of those concerned more sensible of its advantages than myself who had no title to be included in it

Having already satisfied myself as to the several modes in which the four others attained felicity I next set my mind at work to discover what enjoyments were peculiar to the old straggler as the people of the country would have termed the wandering mendicant and prophet As he pretended to familiarity with the devil so I fancied that he was fitted to pursue and take delight in his way of life by possessing some of the mental and moral characteristicsthe lighter and more comic onesof the devil in popular stories Among them might be reckoned a love of deception for its own sake a shrewd eye and keen relish for human weakness and ridiculous infirmity and the talent of petty fraud Thus to this old man there would be pleasure even in the consciousnessso insupportable to some mindsthat his whole life was a cheat upon the world and that so far as he was concerned with the public his little cunning had the upper hand of its united wisdom Every day would furnish him with a succession of minute and pungent triumphsas when for instance his importunity wrung a pittance out of the heart of a miser or when my silly goodnature transferred a part of my slender purse to his plump leather bag or when some ostentatious gentleman should throw a coin to the ragged beggar who was richer than himself or whenthough he would not always be so decidedly diabolicalhis pretended wants should make him a sharer in the scanty living of real indigence And then what an inexhaustible field of enjoyment both as enabling him to discern so much folly and achieve such quantities of minor mischief was opened to his sneering spirit by his pretensions to prophetic knowledge

All this was a sort of happiness which I could conceive of though I had little sympathy with it Perhaps had I been then inclined to admit it I might have found that the roving life was more proper to him than to either of his companions for Satan to whom I had compared the poor man has delighted ever since the time of Job in wandering up and down upon the earth and indeed a crafty disposition which operates not in deeplaid plans but in disconnected tricks could not have an adequate scope unless naturally impelled to a continual change of scene and society

My reflections were here interrupted

Another visitor exclaimed the old showman

The door of the wagon had been closed against the tempest which was roaring and blustering with prodigious fury and commotion and beating violently against our shelter as if it claimed all those homeless people for its lawful prey while we caring little for the displeasure of the elements sat comfortably talking There was now an attempt to open the door succeeded by a voice uttering some strange unintelligible gibberish which my companions mistook for Greek and I suspected to be thieves Latin However the showman stepped forward and gave admittance to a figure which made me imagine either that our wagon had rolled back two hundred years into past ages or that the forest and its old inhabitants had sprung up around us by enchantment It was a red Indian armed with his bow and arrow His dress was a sort of cap adorned with a single feather of some wild bird and a frock of blue cotton girded tight about him on his breast like orders of knighthood hung a crescent and a circle and other ornaments of silver while a small crucifix betokened that our father the pope had interposed between the Indian and the Great Spirit whom he had worshipped in his simplicity This son of the wilderness and pilgrim of the storm took his place silently in the midst of us When the first surprise was over I rightly conjectured him to be one of the Penobscot tribe parties of which I had often seen in their summer excursions down our Eastern rivers There they paddle their birch canoes among the coastingschooners and build their wigwam beside some roaring milldam and drive a little trade in basketwork where their fathers hunted deer Our new visitor was probably wandering through the country toward Boston subsisting on the careless charity of the people while he turned his archery to profitable account by shooting at cents which were to be the prize of his successful aim

The Indian had not long been seated ere our merry damsel sought to draw him into conversation She indeed seemed all made up of sunshine in the month of May for there was nothing so dark and dismal that her pleasant mind could not cast a glow over it and the wild man like a fir tree in his native forest soon began to brighten into a sort of sombre cheerfulness At length she inquired whether his journey had any particular end or purpose

I go shoot at the campmeeting at Stamford replied the Indian

And here are five more said the girl all aiming at the campmeeting too You shall be one of us for we travel with light hearts and as for me I sing merry songs and tell merry tales and am full of merry thoughts and I dance merrily along the road so that there is never any sadness among them that keep me company But oh you would find it very dull indeed to go all the way to Stamford alone

My ideas of the aboriginal character led me to fear that the Indian would prefer his own solitary musings to the gay society thus offered him on the contrary the girls proposal met with immediate acceptance and seemed to animate him with a misty expectation of enjoyment

I now gave myself up to a course of thought which whether it flowed naturally from this combination of events or was drawn forth by a wayward fancy caused my mind to thrill as if I were listening to deep music I saw mankind in this weary old age of the world either enduring a sluggish existence amid the smoke and dust of cities or if they breathed a purer air still lying down at night with no hope but to wear out tomorrow and all the tomorrows which make up life among the same dull scenes and in the same wretched toil that had darkened the sunshine of today But there were some full of the primeval instinct who preserved the freshness of youth to their latest years by the continual excitement of new objects new pursuits and new associates and cared little though their birthplace might have been here in New England if the grave should close over them in Central Asia Fate was summoning a parliament of these free spirits unconscious of the impulse which directed them to a common centre they had come hither from far and near and last of all appeared the representatives of those mighty vagrants who had chased the deer during thousands of years and were chasing it now in the spiritland Wandering down through the waste of ages the woods had vanished around his path his arm had lost somewhat of its strength his foot of its fleetness his mien of its wild regality his heart and mind of their savage virtue and uncultured force but here untamable to the routine of artificial life roving now along the dusty road as of old over the forestleaveshere was the Indian still

Well said the old showman in the midst of my meditations here is an honest company of usone two three four five sixall going to the campmeeting at Stamford Now hoping no offence I should like to know where this young gentleman may be going

I started How came I among these wanderers The free mind that preferred its own folly to anothers wisdom the open spirit that found companions everywhereabove all the restless impulse that had so often made me wretched in the midst of enjoymentsthese were my claims to be of their society

My friends cried I stepping into the centre of the wagon I am going with you to the campmeeting at Stamford

But in what capacity asked the old showman after a moments silence All of us here can get our bread in some creditable way Every honest man should have his livelihood You sir as I take it are a mere strolling gentleman

I proceeded to inform the company that when Nature gave me a propensity to their way of life she had not left me altogether destitute of qualifications for it though I could not deny that my talent was less respectable and might be less profitable than the meanest of theirs My design in short was to imitate the storytellers of whom Oriental travellers have told us and become an itinerant novelist reciting my own extemporaneous fictions to such audiences as I could collect

Either this said I is my vocation or I have been born in vain

The fortuneteller with a sly wink to the company proposed to take me as an apprentice to one or other of his professions either of which undoubtedly would have given full scope to whatever inventive talent I might possess The bibliopolist spoke a few words in opposition to my planinfluenced partly I suspect by the jealousy of authorship and partly by an apprehension that the vivâvoce practice would become general among novelists to the infinite detriment of the book trade

Dreading a rejection I solicited the interest of the merry damsel

Mirth cried I most aptly appropriating the words of LAllegro to thee I sue Mirth admit me of thy crew

Let us indulge the poor youth said Mirth with a kindness which made me love her dearly though I was no such coxcomb as to misinterpret her motives I have espied much promise in him True a shadow sometimes flits across his brow but the sunshine is sure to follow in a moment He is never guilty of a sad thought but a merry one is twinborn with it We will take him with us and you shall see that he will set us all alaughing before we reach the campmeeting at Stamford Her voice silenced the scruples of the rest and gained me admittance into the league according to the terms of which without a community of goods or profits we were to lend each other all the aid and avert all the harm that might be in our power

This affair settled a marvellous jollity entered into the whole tribe of us manifesting itself characteristically in each individual The old showman sitting down to his barrelorgan stirred up the souls of the pigmy people with one of the quickest tunes in the musicbook tailors blacksmiths gentlemen and ladies all seemed to share in the spirit of the occasion and the Merry Andrew played his part more facetiously than ever nodding and winking particularly at me The young foreigner flourished his fiddlebow with a masters hand and gave an inspiring echo to the showmans melody The bookish man and the merry damsel started up simultaneously to dance the former enacting the double shuffle in a style which everybody must have witnessed ere election week was blotted out of time while the girl setting her arms akimbo with both hands at her slim waist displayed such light rapidity of foot and harmony of varying attitude and motion that I could not conceive how she ever was to stop imagining at the moment that Nature had made her as the old showman had made his puppets for no earthly purpose but to dance jigs The Indian bellowed forth a succession of most hideous outcries somewhat affrighting us till we interpreted them as the warsong with which in imitation of his ancestors he was prefacing the assault on Stamford The conjurer meanwhile sat demurely in a corner extracting a sly enjoyment from the whole scene and like the facetious Merry Andrew directing his queer glance particularly at me As for myself with great exhilaration of fancy I began to arrange and color the incidents of a tale wherewith I proposed to amuse an audience that very evening for I saw that my associates were a little ashamed of me and that no time was to be lost in obtaining a public acknowledgment of my abilities

Come fellowlaborers at last said the old showman whom we h"
d elected president the shower is over and we must be doing our duty by these poor souls at Stamford,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Well come among them in procession with music and dancing cried the merry damsel,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Accordinglyfor it must be understood that our pilgrimage was to be performed on footwe sallied joyously out of the wagon each of us even the old gentleman in his white topboots giving a great skip as we came down the ladder Above our heads there was such a glory of sunshine and splendor of clouds and such brightness of verdure below that as I modestly remarked at the time Nature seemed to have washed her face and put on the best of her jewelry and a fresh green gown in honor of our confederation Casting our eyes northward we beheld a horseman approaching leisurely and splashing through the little puddle on the Stamford road Onward he came sticking up in his saddle with rigid perpendicularity a tall thin figure in rusty black whom the showman and the conjurer shortly recognized to be what his aspect sufficiently indicateda travelling preacher of great fame among the Methodists What puzzled us was the fact that his face appeared turned from instead of to the campmeeting at Stamford However as this new votary of the wandering life drew near the little green space where the guidepost and our wagon were situated my six fellowvagabonds and myself rushed forward and surrounded him crying out with united voices What news What news from the campmeeting at Stamford,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
The missionary looked down in surprise at as singular a knot of people as could have been selected from all his heterogeneous auditors Indeed considering that we might all be classified under the general head of Vagabond there was great diversity of character among the grave old showman the sly prophetic beggar the fiddling foreigner and his merry damsel the smart bibliopolist the sombre Indian and myself the itinerant novelist a slender youth of eighteen I even fancied that a smile was endeavoring to disturb the iron gravity of the preachers mouth,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Good people answered he the campmeeting is broke up,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
So saying the Methodist minister switched his steed and rode westward Our union being thus nullified by the removal of its object we were sundered at once to the four winds of heaven The fortuneteller giving a nod to all and a peculiar wink to me departed on his Northern tour chuckling within himself as he took the Stamford road The old showman and his literary coadjutor were already tackling their horses to the wagon with a design to peregrinate southwest along the seacoast The foreigner and the merry damsel took their laughing leave and pursued the eastern road which I had that day trodden as they passed away the young man played a lively strain and the girls happy spirit broke into a dance and thus dissolving as it were into sunbeams and gay music that pleasant pair departed from my view Finally with a pensive shadow thrown across my mind yet emulous of the light philosophy of my late companions I joined myself to the Penobscot Indian and set forth toward the distant city,,,,,,,,,

For playing with his sanity
Somebody should have warned him
To stay away from girls like me but

      I can see you over there
      Starring at your drink
      Watchin that ice sink
      All alone tonight
      And chances are
      Youre sittin here in this bar
      Cause he aint gonna treat you right
      Well its probably not my place
      But Im gonna say it anyway
      Cause you look like
      You havent felt the fire
      Had a little fun
      Hadnt had a smile in a little while
      Baby
      Cause blue looks good on the sky
      Looks good on that neon buzzin on the wall
      But darling it dont match your eyes

      But I just dont understand
      How another man
      Can take your sun
      And turn it ice cold
      Well Ive had enough to drink
      And its makin
      Me think that I just might
      Tell you if I were a painter I wouldnt change ya

      Wasted Time
      The rain is coming down tonight
      Im smiling looking at this photograph
      I hear that song and Im flying right back
      To when we had it made
      Every Friday night when the sun went down
      Wed be running them streets like we owned the town
      And I just cant let it go no I just cant let it go
      I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
      Seven kids on my two lane road
      Had the guns on the radio
      After all this time it still feels feels so good
      When I think about those summer nights
      Singing out the window on the back roads
      Sweet Child of Mine
      Sipping on the locals spark of light
      Aint it funny how the best days of my life
      Was all that wasted time all that wasted time
      Out of nowhere it slipped away
      And the rope by the river hangs silently
      And the town that I knew aint nothing like it used to be
      Ah I cant explain
      They took all the color from the picture frame
      And the days got sold to the grid and the game
      And I just cant let it go no I just cant let it go
      I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
      Seven kids on my two lane road
      We had the guns on the radio
      After all this time it still feels feels so good
      When I think about those summer nights
      Singing out the window on the back roads
      Sweet Child of Mine
      Sipping on the locals spark of light
      Aint it funny how the best days of my life
      Was all that wasted time all that wasted time
      Swinging on the line
      Living all that wasted time
      Hey hey now
      Summer dresses rained on the hood of the car
      Only music that we had was out the left speaker
      We were living every second til the time ran out
      We had nothing but we had it all
      When I think about those summer night
      Sneaking out the window running back roads
      Your hand in mine
      We were going nowhere we were so alive
      Uh huh aint it funny how the best days of my life
      Was all that wasted time all that wasted time
      We were swinging out on the line
      Living all that wasted time
      Hey you know oh
      All that wasted time
      Dont you feel it coming on back now

      And all I remember is your back
      
      Walking towards the airport leaving us all in your past
      
      I traveled fifteen hundred miles to see you
      
      Begged you to want me but you didnt want to
      
      But piece by piece he collected me
      Up off the ground where you abandoned things and
      Piece by piece he filled the holes that you burned in me
      Six years old and you know he never walks away
      He never asks for money he takes care of me
      He loves me
      Piece by piece he restored my faith
      That a man can be kind and a father could stay
      
      And all of your words fall flat
      I made something of myself and now you want to come back
      
      But your love it isnt free it has to be earned
      
      Back then I didnt have anything you needed so I was worthless
      
      But piece by piece he collected me
      Up off the ground where you abandoned things and
      Piece by piece he filled the holes that you burned in me
      Six years old and you know he never walks away
      He never asks for money he takes care of me
      Cause he loves me

      Piece by piece I fell far from the tree
      I will never leave her like you left me
      And she will never have to wonder her worth
      Because unlike you Im going to put her first
      And you know hell never walk away
      Hell never break her heart
      Hell take care of things hell love her

      Johnny caught a body yesterday out hustlin
      God bless America you know we all love him
      Yesterday I got a call like from my dog like    
      Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
      He was sobbin he was mobbin way belligerent and drunk
      Talkin out his head philosphin on what the lord had done
      He said KDot can you pray for me Its been a  up day for me
      I know that you anointed show me how to overcome
      He was lookin for some closure hopin I could bring him closer
      To the spiritual my spirit do no better but I told him
      I cant sugar coat the answer for you this is how I feel
      If somebody kill my son that mean that somebodys gettin killed
      Tell me what you do for love loyalty and passion of
      All the memories collected moments you could never touch
      I wait in front a s spot and watch him hit his block
      Ill catch a  leavin service if thats all I got
      Ill chip a  then throw the blower in his lap
      Walk myself to the court like  I did that
      Aint no black power when your baby killed by a coward
      I cant even keep the peace dont you  with one of ours
      It be murder in the street it be bodies in the hour
      Ghetto bird on the street paramedics on the dial
      Let somebody touch my momma touch my sister touch my woman
      Touch my daddy touch my niece touch my nephew touch my brother
      You should chip a  then throw the blower in his lap
      Matter fact Im bout to speak at this convention call you back
      
      Its not a place
      This country is to be a sound of drum and bass
      You close your eyes to look around
      
      Hail Mary Jesus and Joseph
      The great American flag is wrapped and dragged with explosives
      Compulsive disorder sons and daughters
      Barricaded blocks and borders
      Look what you taught us
      Its murder on my street
      Yall street back streets
      Wall street corporate offices banks
      Employees and bosses with homicidal thoughts
      Donald Trumps in office we lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again
      But is America honest or do we bask in sin
      Pass the gin I mix it with American blood
      Then bash him in you crippin or you married to blood
      Ill ask again oops accident
      Its nasty when you set us up then roll the dice then bet us up
      You overnight the big rifles then tell Fox to be scared of us
      Gang members or terrorists et cetera et cetera
      Americas reflections of me
      Thats what a mirror does
      
      Its not a place

Is it wickedness
Is it weakness
You decide
Are we gonna live or die

Verse Kendrick Lamar
So I was takin a walk the other day
And I seen a womana blind woman
Pacin up and down the sidewalk
She seemed to be a bit frustrated
As if she had dropped somethin and
Havin a hard time findin it
So after watchin her struggle for a while
I decide to go over and lend a helping hand you know
Hello maam can I be of any assistance
It seems to me that you have lost something
I would like to help you find it
She replied Oh yes you have lost something
Youve lost your life

Verse Kendrick Lamar
Oh Lamar
Hail Mary and marijuana times is hard
Pray with the hooligans shadows all in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives Im a star
Life is one funny mothafucka
A true comedian you gotta love him you gotta trust him
I might be buggin infomercials and no sleep
Introverted by my thoughts children listen it gets deep
See once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects
The object was to process and digest povertys dialect
Adaptation inevitable gun violence crack spot
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Anthony was the oldest of seven
Wellrespected calm and collected
Laughin and jokin made life easier hard times mama on crack
A fouryearold tellin his nanny he needed her
His family history pimpin and bangin
He was meant to be dangerous
Clocked him a grip and start slangin
Fifteen scrapin up his jeans with quarter pieces
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
Dodged a policeman workin for his big homie
Smalltime hustler graduated to a brick on him
      dollars out of a project housing thats on the daily
Seen his first mil twenty years old had a couple of babies
Had a couple of shooters
Caught a murder case fingerprints on the gun they assumin
But witnesses couldnt prove it
That was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin
Birdshufflin Anthony rang
The first in the projects with the twotone Mustang
That    thing they say    came
Circlin parking lots and parking spots
And hoppin out while harrassin the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it
He brushed em off and walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken
See at this chicken spot
There was a lightskinned nigga that talked a lot
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth
He worked the window his name was Ducky
He came from the streets the Robert Taylor Homes
Southside Projects Chiraq the Terror Dome
Drove to California with a woman on him and     dollars
They had a son hopin that hed see college
Hustlin on the side with a ninetofive to freak it
Cadillac Seville hed ride his son around on weekends
Threepiece special with his name on the shirt pocket
Cross the street from the projects Anthony planned to rob it
Stuck up the place before back in   
Thats when affiliation was really at gears of war
So many relatives tellin us sellin us devilish works
Killin us crime intelligent felonious
Prevalent proposition with  s
Ducky was wellaware
They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
He figured hed get on these niggas good sides
Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line
Two extra biscuits Anthony liked him and then let him slide
They didnt kill him in fact it look like theyre the last to survive
Pay attention that one decision changed both of they lives
One curse at a time
Reverse the manifest and good karma and Ill tell you why
You take two strangers and put em in random predicaments
Give em a soul so they can make their own choices and live with it
Twenty years later them same strangers you make em meet again
Inside recording studios where they reapin their benefits
Then you start remindin them about that chicken incident
Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence
Because if Anthony killed Ducky Top Dawg could be servin life
While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight

Verse   Kendrick Lamar
When I was    I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated    times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money is God playin a joke on me
Is it for the moment and will he see me as Job
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before
At    my biggest fear was losin it all
Scared to spend money had me sleepin from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section   with my mama stressin
   shows a month and I still wont buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor Somebody thats holdin my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt
I read a case about Rihannas accountant and wondered
How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers
The type of shitll make me flip out and just kill somethin
Drill somethin get ill and fill ratchets with a lil somethin
I practiced runnin from fear guess I had some good luck
At    years old my biggest fear was bein judged
How they look at me reflect on myself my family my city
What they say bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me would make em highlight my simplest lines

Verse   Kendrick Lamar
Im talkin fear fear of losin creativity
Im talkin fear fear of missin out on you and me
Im talkin fear fear of losin loyalty from pride
Cause my DNA wont let me involve in the light of God
Im talkin fear fear that my humbleness is gone
Im talkin fear fear that love aint livin here no more
Im talkin fear fear that its wickedness or weakness
Fear whatever it is both is distinctive
Fear what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I cant take these feelings with me so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks carried out over wax
Searchin for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I cant take these feelings with me so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks carried out over wax
Wonderin if Im livin through fear or livin through rap

Verse   says You only have I known of all the families of the Earth therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities
So until we come back to these commandments
Until you come back to these commandments
We gonna feel this way we gonna be under this curse
Because He said Hes gonna punish us
The socalled Blacks Hispanics and Native American Indians
Are the true children of Israel
We are the Israelites according to the Bible
The children of Israel
Hes gonna punish us for our iniquities for our disobedience
Because we chose to follow other gods
That man chastens his son so the Lord thy God chasten thee
So just like you chasten your own son Hes gonna chasten you
Because He loves you so thats why we get chastised
Thats why were in the position that were in
Until we come back to these laws statutes and commandments
And do what the Lord says these curses is gonna be upon us
We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live

      If I quit your BM I still ride Mercedes funk
      If I quit this season I still be the greatest funk
      My left stroke just went viral

Chorus Kendrick Lamar
I need some water somethin came over me
Way too hot to simmer down might as well overheat
Too close to comfort as blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racin like a junkies I just need you to want me
Am I askin too much Let me put the head in
Ooh I dont want more than that girl I respect the cat
I promise just a touch let me put the head in
If its okay she said Its okay

Interlude Kendrick Lamar  RAT BOY
Yeah I need everybodys motherfuckin hands up right now

Verse   Kendrick Lamar  RAT BOY
Wake up in the mornin thinkin bout money kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy take a shit then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick go fuck on a bitch
Dont go to work today cop you a fit
Or maybe some kicks and make you
Door and his Nike Air Rattles
Rush the fire exit no time for battles
Well I I never expected
Wake up in the mornin thinkin bout money kick your feet up
Watch you a comedyhol up
Wake up in the mornin thinkin bout money kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy take a shit then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick go fuck on a bitch dont go to work today
Cop you a fit or maybe some kicks and make it work today
Hang with the homies stunt on your baby mama
Sip some lean go get a pistol shoot out the window
Bet your favorite team play you some Madden
Go to the club or your mama house
Whatever you doin just make it count I need some water
Wake up in the mornin thinkin bout money kick your feet up
Hop in the shower put on your makeup lace your weave up
Touch on yourself call up your nigga tell him he aint shit
Credit card scam get you a Visa make it pay your rent
Hop on the Gram flex on the bitches that be hatin on you
Pop you a pill call up your bitches have em waitin on you
Go to the club have you some fun make that ass bounce
Its whatever just make it count

Chorus Kendrick Lamar

Verse   Kendrick Lamar
I wake in the mornin my head spinnin from the last night
Both in a trance feelings are deadwhat a fast life
Manager called the lobby call is     
Did this before promised myself Id be a hour early
Room full of clothes bag full of money call it loose change
Fumbled my jewelry    k I lost a new chain
Hop on the bird hit the next city for another M
Take me a nap then do it again
We all woke up tryna tune to the daily news
Lookin for confirmation hopin election wasnt true
All of us worried all of us buried and our feelings deep
None of us married to his proposal make us feel cheap
Stale and sad distraught and mad tell the neighbor bout it
Bet they agree parade the streets with your voice proudly
Time passin things change
Revertin back to our daily programs stuck in our ways
Lust

Bridge Kendrick Lamar
Lately I feel like I been lustin over the fame
Lately we lust on the same routine of shame
Lately lately lately my lust been heightened Lately
Lately its all contradiction
Lately Im not here
Lately I lust over self
Lust turn into fear
Lately in James    says
Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord
Brace yourself lust is all yours

Chorus Kendrick Lamar
I need some water somethin came over me
Way too hot to simmer down might as well overheat
Too close to comfort as blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racin like a junkies I just need you to want me

      When the song comin out of the speakers
      Was the band that you had on your tshirt
      We were screamin cause all the streets were empty
      And you kissed me and we were 
      Up all night and we were feelin so good
      Yeah we got a little higher than we probably should
      We were in a hotel singin in the hallway lights
      We were strikin the matches right down to the ashes
      Setting the world on fire setting the world on fire
      Wrote I love you in lipstick on the mirror
      We were shoutin out the window like they could hear us at the pier
      Said Do you think well live forever As we killed another beer
      And you wrote I love you in lipstick on the mirror
      We were laughin until we were breathless
      Never felt anything so reckless we were all lit up and restless

Verse   Kid Rock
Living my life in a slow hell
Different girl every night at the hotel
I aint seen the sunshine in three damn days
Been fueling up on cocaine and whiskey
Wish I had a good girl to miss me
Lord I wonder if Ill ever change my ways

Hook Kid Rock
I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I cant look at you while Im lying next to her
I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I cant look at you while Im lying next to her

Verse   Sheryl Crow
I called you last night in the hotel
Everyone knows but they wont tell
But their halfhearted smiles tell me something just aint right
Ive been waiting on you for a long time
Fuelin up on heartaches and cheap wine
I aint heard from you in three damn nights

Hook Sheryl Crow
I put your picture away
I wonder where youve been
I cant look at you while Im lying next to him
I put your picture away
I wonder where youve been
I cant look at you while Im lying next to him

Verse   Sheryl Crow  Kid Rock Both
I saw you yesterday with an old friend
It was the same old same how have you been
Since youve been gone my worlds been dark and grey
You reminded me of brighter days
I hoped you were coming home to stay
I was headed to church
I was off to drink you away
I thought about you for a long time
Cant seem to get you off my mind
I cant understand why were living life this way

Chorus Kid Rock  Sheryl Crow
I found your picture today
I swear Ill change my ways
I just called to say I want you
To come back home
I found your picture today
I swear Ill change my ways
I just called to say I want you
To come back home

Outro Kid Rock  Sheryl Crow
I just called to say I love you
Come back home

      I think about that day
      I left him at a Greyhound station
      West of Sante Fe
      We were seventeen but he was sweet and it was true
      Still I did what I had to do
      Cuz I just knew
      
      Summer Sunday nights
      Wed sink into our seats
      Right as they dimmed out all the lights
      The Technicolor world made out of music and machine
      It called me to be on that screen
      And  live inside each scene
      
      Without a nickel to my name
      Hopped a bus here I came
      Could be brave or just insane
      Well have to see
      Cuz maybe in that sleepy town
      Hell sit one day the lights are down
      Hell see my face and think of how he used to know me
      
      Climb the hills Im reaching for the heights
      And chasing all the lights that shine
      And when they let you down
      Youll get up off the ground
      As morning rolls around
      And its another day of sun
      
      I hear them everyday
      The rhythms in the canyons that will never fade away
      The ballads  In the barrooms  left by those who came before
      They say you gotta want it more
      So I bang on every door
      
      And even when the answers no
      Or when my moneys running low
      The dusty mic and neon glow are all I need
      
      And some day as I sing the song
      A smalltown kid will come along
      Thatll be the thing to push him on and hell go
      
      Climb the hills Im reaching for the heights
      And chasing all the lights that shine
      And when they let you down
      Youll get up off the ground
      As morning rolls around
      And its another day of sun
      
      When they let you down
      The morning rolls around
      
      Its another day of sun
      Its another day of sun
      Its another day of sun
      Its another day of sun
      Just another day of sun
      Its another day of sun
      The day has just begun
      Its another day of sun
      
      Its another day of sun"

Boy youre gonna hate this town
Wish you could burn it down
That fire in your eyes is    counties wide
But boy youre gonna love   
And boy youll do some stupid things

Chorus
Youre gonna drive and kiss
And throw a punch
And grow up way too fast
Youre gonna drop the ball
Hit the wall
And break some hearts like glass
I know you well cause youre a part of me
And a part of you will always be a boy

Verse  
Youre gonna be so stubborn
You get that from your mother
I already see it now you werent built for backing down
And boy therell be a small town night
And youll fall for her skyblue eyes
And when shes in your hands
Youll think youre a man and not a boy
Shell make you lose your mind boy
Shell be every reason why

Chorus
Youre gonna drive and kiss
And throw a punch
And grow up way too fast
Youre gonna drop the ball
Hit the wall
And break some hearts like glass
I know you will cause youre a part of me
And a part of you will always bemy boy

And that face will be the same one in the rearview
The day I watch you leave

Outro
But boy youre gonna come back home
Youre gonna settle down
But you wont feel the way Im feelin now
Til you have a boy
Hes gonna know it all
Hell think hes ten feet tall
And run like hes bulletproof

    See Im a fool for pain Im a dummy

    Tongue kiss a shark got jealous es up in the boat
    Eating peanut butter and jelly fishes on toast
    And if I get stung I get stoked might choke
    Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal
    Naked in the North Pole
    Thats why my heart cold full of sorrow the lost soul
    And only Lord knows when Im coming to the crossroads
    So I dont fear t but tomorrow
    And Im a sucker for pain it aint nothing but pain
    You just  complain you aint tough as you claim
    Just stay up in your lane just dont  with Lil Wayne
    Imma jump from a plane or stand in front of a train
    Cause Im a sucker for pain
    Used to doing bad now we feel like we just now getting it
    Aint got no other way so we started and finished it
    No pain no gain
    Never stand down made our own way
    Never going slow we pick up the pace
    This is what we wanted from a young age
    No emotion thats what business is
    Lord have mercy on the witnesses
    I torture you
    Take my hand through the flames

      Say that I should retreat
      That Im marching to the rhythm
      Of a lonesome defeat
      But the sound of your voice
      Puts the pain in reverse
      No surrender no illusions

      Still gotta walk into a crowded room

      Crack a smile and crack a beer like it dont bother you
      Like it aint your song thats on
      Still gotta cross the bridge to get to work
      The once by her place
      Make it through the   to   like you dont hurt
      It goes that way
      When someone stops loving you
      It dont make the evening news
      It dont keep the sun from rising the clock from winding
      Your heart from beating even when you want it to
      When someone stops loving you
      
      Still gotta button up your collared shirt
      The one she used to button down
      Sleep on the mattress where her body left a curve
      Or maybe just the couch
      Still gotta keep her number in your phone
      In case she calls back
      One night when shes drunk and all alone
      Yeah you pray for that
      When someone stops loving you
      It dont make the evening news
      It dont keep the sun from rising the clock from winding
      Your heart from beating even when you want it to
      When someone stops loving you
      
      There hardest part about it is
      There aint a switch that you can flip

Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro

Estribillo Luis Fonsi  Daddy Yankee
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo

Firmar las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
Sube sube sube sube sube

PostEstribillo Luis Fonsi  Daddy Yankee

Verso   Daddy Yankee
Si te pido un beso ven dámelo yo sé que estás pensándolo eh
Llevo tiempo intentándolo Eh mami esto es dando y dándolo
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bambam
Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bambam
Ven prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe Eheh plo
Quiero quiero quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empezamos lento después salvaje

PreEstribillo Daddy Yankee
Pasito a pasito suave suavecito
Nos vamo pegando poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
Pasito a pasito suave suavecito
Nos vamo pegando poquito a poquito Ohoh
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas No no
Pero pa montarlo aquí tengo la pieza
Oye Yo yo plo

Estribillo Luis Fonsi  Daddy Yankee
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito Yo
Deja que te diga cosas al oído Yo

Que le enseñes a mi boca Woh eh
Tus lugares favoritos Favorito favorito baby
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro Eh woh eh

Vamo a hacerlo en una playa en Puerto Rico
Hasta que las olas griten Ay Bendito
Para que mi sello se quede contigo
Báilalo

       Go make yourself some friends or youll be lonely
       Once I was seven years old
       It was a big big world but we thought we were bigger
       Pushing each other to the limits we were learning quicker
       By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
       Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure
       Once I was eleven years old my daddy told me
       Go get yourself a wife or youll be lonely
       Once I was eleven years old
       I always had that dream like my daddy before me
       So I started writing songs I started writing stories
       Something about the glory just always seemed to bore me
       Cause only those I really love will ever really know me
       Once I was    years old my story got told
       Before the morning sun when life was lonely
       Once I was    years old
       Lukas Graham
       I only see my goals I dont believe in failure
       Cause I know the smallest voices they can make it major
       I got my boys with me at least those in favor
       And if we dont meet before I leave I hope Ill see you later
       Once I was    years old my story got told
       I was writing about everything I saw before me
       Once I was    years old
       Soon well be    years old our songs have been sold
       Weve traveled around the world and were still roaming
       Soon well be    years old
       Im still learning about life
       My woman brought children for me
       So I can sing them all my songs
       And I can tell them stories
       Most of my boys are with me
       Some are still out seeking glory
       And some I had to leave behind
       My brother Im still sorry
       Soon Ill be    years old my daddy got   
       Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
       I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
       I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month
       Soon Ill be    years old will I think the world is cold
       Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
       Soon Ill be    years old
       Soon Ill be    years old will I think the world is cold
       Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
       Soon Ill be    years old
       Once I was seven years old my momma told me
       Go make yourself some friends or youll be lonely
       Once I was seven years old
       Once I was seven years old"

    Mama said that is was OK
    Mama said that is was quite alright
    Our kind of people had a bed for the night and it was OK
    Mama told us we are good kids
    And daddy told us never listen to the ones
    Pointing nasty figers and making fun
    Cause we were good kids
    Remember asking both my mom and dad
    Why we never travelled to exotic lands
    We only ever really visit friends
    Nothing to tell when the summer ends
    We never really went buying clothes
    Folks were passing the stuff in plenty loads
    New shoes once a year and then
    Out to play ball so we could ruin them
    Our kind of people had a bed for the night
    And it was OK
    Mama told us we were good kids
    Pointing nasty fingers and making fun
    Cause we were good kids
    Dont get me wrong I didnt have it bad
    I got enough loving from my and dad
    But I dont think they really undersand
    When I said that I wanted to deal in Hollywood
    I told I might be singing on TV
    The other kids were calling me a wannabe
    The older kids they started bugging me
    But now they are all standing right in front of me
    When mama said that is was OK
    Mama said that it was quite alright
    Our kind of people had a bed for the night
    And it was OK
    Mama told us we were good kids
    And daddy told us never listen to the ones
    Pointing nasty fingers and making fun
    Cause we were good kids
    I know which place Im from I know my home
    When Im in doubt and struggling
    Thats where Ill go
    And old friend can give advice
    When new friends only know the half story
    Thats why I always keep them tight
    And why Im OK
    I said Im OK
    You know what my mama said
    You know what she told me
    My mama said that is was OK
    Mama said that it was quite alright
    Our kind of people had a bed for the night
    And it was OK
    Mama said that we were good kids
    And daddy told us never listen to the ones
    Pointing nasty fingers and making fun
    Mama said that is was OK

    When mama said that is was OK
    Babada Babadadada
    When mama said that is was OK
      And mama said that is was OK

Verse  
Fast
Thats the kind of car you wanna drive when youre sixteen
Fast
Thats the kind of boys that you want on your home team
Fast
Yeah you think youre gonna catch your big dreams just like that
Fast
And here you are looking back

Chorus
Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Ticktock wont stop around it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
All you keep trying to do is slow it down soak it in
Youre trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you cant man
It just goes too fast

Verse  
Fast
Thats what your parents said when we were falling in love
Its too fast
There aint no way the two of us were ever going to last
But we did and here we are and our only problem is

Chorus
Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Ticktock wont stop around it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
All you keep trying to do is slow it down soak it in
Youre trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you cant man
It just goes too fast

Bridge
Looking at you looking out the window right now
Those eyes that dress that smile that laugh
If I could hit pause I would somehow
But it dont work like that

Chorus
Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Ticktock wont stop around it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
All you keep trying to do is slow it down soak it in
Youre trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you cant man
It goes too fast
It just goes too fast
Way too fast

      Your mama packed yall up and moved you to the south
      Packed a UHaul cross a onetree yard
      To a tin roof shotgun house
      You didnt know nobody didnt talk too much
      Had a rocking little body with a yankee strut
      A little shy side a little wild side
      With your long blonde hair all pulled up
      Then you got in with some southern belles
      Cut your jeans off with a rebel yell
      Learned the talk of the Bible belt
      Now girl I melt when you

      In a long time
      Till I bumped into some of your friends
      Over there talkin to mine
      Then you roll in with your hair in the wind
      Baby without warning
      I was doin alright but just your sight
      Had my heart stormin
      The moon went hiding
      Stars quit shining
      Rain was dropping
      Thunder n lightning
      You wrecked my whole world when you came
      And hit me like a hurricane
      You hit me like a hurricane
      Knew it was gonna be a long night
      From the moment when
      We locked eyes over whiskey on ice
      Talkin bout us again
      If I woulda just layed my drink down
      And walked out
      I wouldnt be in my truck
      Driving us to your house

    If youre anything like me
    you just might be doing whatever it takes to drown out the noise
    But I just wanna hear your voice
    And Im one number away from calling to you
     I said I was throughbut Im dying inside
    Got my head in a messgirl I confess
     I lied when I saidIm leaving and not coming back
    Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
    But everywhere I go I see your face
    In my brain dial it up everything I want to say
    But Im still one number away
    Are you stuck at a red light with Marboro Light on your lips
    Does the smoke in your mirror get clearer without my kiss
    Are you changing the station replacing our favourite song
    Maybe its a mistake hit the brakes Im moving on

      Flower bearin call it petals to the floor
      Power sharin call it devils to the door
      Power power til aint no devils anymore
      Flower flowers they be droppin at the feet of my son
      Move a thousand miles per hour down the street of my slum
      And who do I meet to the beat of my drum
      It was little Susie Uzi she sold crack and was a killer
      All bitch dope tip wasnt trappin with no niggas
      Had a long money minor do that action for them figures
      Her influence fully automatic crackin off the Richter yeah
      Walked up to my ride asked me could she get inside
      She pointed at her pistol so I properly replied
      Told me out here in the streets she aint have no competition
      And with me up on them beats then we shared the same description
      With a blunt between her lips she said Now heres my proposition
      You just write a bunch of raps for me and Ima go and spit em
      Then we take em to the radio the DJ better spin em
      Then we take em to the record store and sell a couple million
      
      I already got the money already got the bitches

      Not that Superstar shit she wanted somethin for the streets
      Said it might take like a month she said it better take a week
      Gave my arm a little punch and then she pointed at her heat
      Said I saw that thing the first time you dont gotta do it twice
      But I need a lil more info on exactly what I write
      Some details bout a female bout your life and what you like
      She said My life is like a bitch and Im just like my life
      Then powpowpowpowpow yeah them niggas started bussin
      Like that boycott was over and that we had overcome it
      She said Nigga hit the gas went from zero to a hunnid
      Now we runnin from some killers I was so sick to my stomach
      She was hangin out the window with that thumper she was dumpin
      Had a look upon her face that made me think that she was cummin
      We was swervin jumped the curb
      And ditched the whip and started runnin
      Tried to jump over a wall but it was a little tall
      So we ducked behind a bush and thats how we got overlooked
      I was shook and breathin hard
      And she was sittin there smokin kush
      Then we both started to glow we looked around like What is this

Verse   Marc E Bassy
Girl you party all the time
Dont let me stay on your mind
Adderall and cheap wine
Just to stay awake in conversation
We were always so damn insecure
So how could we ever know for sure
And disregard the way I know we feel
That would make this city way too real

Chorus Marc E Bassy
If we bump into each other
On a crowded street
Its not us no more
Its just you and me
Were just strangers in passing casually
Its not us no more
Its just you and me

Verse   Marc E Bassy
The shirt on my back with the rips
Gems in my golden necklace
You didnt give me none of this
Theres nothing for me to miss
We were too young on the day we met
How could we say we would not forget
And in the shadows theres a place for us
Somewhere hidden they cant find our love
Dont let em know

Chorus Marc E Bassy
If we bump into each other
On a crowded street
Its not us no more
Its just you and me
Were just strangers in passing casually
Its not us no more
Its just you and me

Verse   GEazy
Eazy and these days its just you and me
This shit is dead and gone its not what it used to be
Someone give a eulogy
Know Im hard headed and I might of acted foolishly
But you the one to hold us down usually
We was in a limbo
But of all people you aint have to fuck with him though
That was my homie I had gave yall the intro
Some things fall apart and some get thrown out the window
Remember when we first met we mightve been too young
But we was from The Bay so we both was going too dumb
I used to be the one for you now you got a new one
So till the next lifetime maybe we can do somen
Eazy

Hook Marc E Bassy
If we bump into each other
On a crowded street

Its just you and me
Were just strangers in passing casually
Its not us no more Its just you and me

      We were too young on the day we met
      How could we say we would not forget
      And in the shadows theres a place for us
      Somewhere hidden they cant find our love
      Dont let em know
      If we bump into each other
      On a crowded street
      Its not us no more
      Its just you and me
      Were just strangers in passing casually
      Its not us no more
      Its just you and me
      Eazy and these days its just you and me
      This shit is dead and gone its not what it used to be
      Someone give a eulogy
      I know Im hard headed and I might of acted foolishly
      But you the one to hold us down usually
      We was in a limbo
      But of all people you aint have to  with him though
      That was my homie I had gave yall the intro
      Some things fall apart and some get thrown out the window
      Remember when we first met we mightve been too young
      But we was from The Bay so we both was going too dumb
      I used to be the one for you now you got a new one
      So till the next lifetime maybe we can do somen
      If we bump into each other
      On a crowded street
      Its not us no more
      Its just you and me
      Were just strangers in passing casually
      Its not us no more
      Its just you and me
      If we bump into each other
      On a crowded street
      Its not us no more"

       So brightly everywhere
       And the sound of childrens
       Laughter fills the air
       And everyone is singing

      Burning in my eyes and you and I
      Heated by the flicker of a lighter
      Oh and I let it go
      But I just got here
      I know its been a while darling dear
      Theres been a change in the time of year
      When the frost bites the snow
      And Christmas comes around
      For the down and outs
      And broken layabouts
      What will they do now
      When Christmas comes around
      We were so in love
      Till I messed it up
      But who will love me now
      When Christmas comes around
      Family asking me why I let you go
      Telling me its a mistake
      Im telling them that I know
      But I cant call you
      Your inner space better place
      Loving on a new man
      I dont blame you at all
      You did all that you can I know
      But I just got here
      I know its been a while darling dear
      Theres been a change in the time of year

      We were so in love
      Till I messed it up
      But who will love me now
      When Christmas comes around
      And Im sick of all the songs
      The Christmas singalongs
      The merry and the cheer
      Cuz I dont feel like that this year
      All the bells are all in sync
      And my soul is on the brink
      So Ill have myself a drink and sing
      Christmas comes around
      For the down and outs
      And broken layabouts
      What will they do now
      When Christmas comes around
      We were so in love

      Im goin crazy on niggas too wavy for niggas
      Do magic like alakazam
      Im in the kitchen compressin a birdie
      Take out a nine and I sell it for thirty

      Its easy to sing

      When Im held to the flame

      To move a mountain
      Good thing
      A little faith is all I have right now

      To leave mountains unmovable
      Give me the strength to be able to sing

      Take a look at the five and ten
      Its glistening once again
      With candy canes and silver lanes aglow
      
      Its beginning to look a lot like Christmas
      Toys in every store
      But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
      On your own front door
      
      A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots
      Is the wish of Barney and Ben
      Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
      Is the hope of Janice and Jen
      And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again
      
      Its beginning to look a lot like Christmas
      Everywhere you go
      Theres a tree in the Grand Hotel one in the park as well
      Its the sturdy kind that doesnt mind the snow
      
      Its beginning to look a lot like Christmas
      Soon the bells will start
      And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
      Right within your heart

Did you ever want it
Did you want it bad
Ohhh my
It tears me apart
Did you ever fight it
All of the pain
So much pride
Running through my veins

PreChorus
Bleeding Im bleeding
My cold little heart
Oh I I cant stand myself

Chorus
And I know
In my heart in this cold heart
I can live or I can die
I believe if I just try
You believe in you and I
In you and I
In you and I
In you and I

Verse  
Did you ever notice
Ive been ashamed
All my life
Ive been playing games
We can try and hide it
Its all the same
Ive been losing you
One day at a time

PreChorus
Bleeding Im bleeding
My cold little heart
Oh I I cant stand myself

And I know
In my heart in this cold heart

But since I know who I am
Im probably wrong
Maybe this time I can go far
But thinking about where Ive been
Aint helping me start

      Midnights creepin in we know better
      Than leaving here together
      And in case you were wondering
      Youve never looked hotter
      So why even bother
      Looking at the reasons not to
      Maybe we ought to
      
      Kiss a little more think a little less
      Burning up the night like a cigarette
      And get you out of this bar out of that dress
      And kiss a little more
      And kiss a little more think a little less
      
      When your friends start asking you look em in the eyes
      Tell a white lie
      How I dropped you off at home and I walked you to the door
      Nothing more
      Tomorrow you can say were just friends
      But baby til then
      
      We can kiss a little more think a little less
      Burning up the night like a cigarette
      And get you out of this bar out of that dress

      To say goodbye to your friends
      Aint gotta go home
      But we gotta get gone
      Cause weve already waited way too long to
      Kiss a little more
      Think a little less
      Do the only thing weve been thinking bout doing since the moment girl we met
      
      Kiss a little more think a little less
      Burning up the night like a cigarette

Verse  
I took a pill in Ibiza to show Avicii I was cool
And when I finally got sober felt    years older
But fuck it it was something to do
Im living out in LA I drive a sports car just to prove
Im a real big baller cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes

Chorus
But you dont wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You dont ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
You dont wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You dont wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs sad songs
Darling all I know are sad songs sad songs

PostChorus
II know are sad songs
II know are sad songs
II know are sad songs
II know are sad songs

Verse  
Im just a singer who already blew his shot
I get along with old timers
Cause my names a reminder of a pop song people forgot
And I cant keep a girl no
Cause as soon as the sun comes up
I cut em all loose and works my excuse
But the truth is I cant open up

Chorus
But you dont wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You dont ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
You dont wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You dont wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs sad songs
Darling all I know are sad songs sad songs

Verse  
I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here and Im happy that you did
Cause now Im as free as birds catchin the wind
I always thought I would sink so I never swam
I never went boatin dont get how they are floatin
And sometimes I get so scared of what I cant understand

Chorus
But here I am next to you
The skys more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you

Verse  
We watched the sun go down as we were walkin
Id spent the rest of my life just standing here talkin
You would explain the current as I just smile
Hoping that youll stay the same and nothing will change
And itll be us just for a while
Do they even exist
Thats when I make a wish to swim away with the fish
Cause its supposed to be this hot all summer long
I never wouldve believed you if three years ago you told me
Id be here writing this song

Chorus
But here I am next to you
The skys so blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you
Next to you
The skys so blue in Malibu
Next to you

Outro
We are just like the waves that flow back and forth
Sometimes I feel like Im drowning
And youre there to save me
And I wanna thank you with all of my heart
Its a brand new start
A dream come true in Malibu

      Hey there Mr Tin Man
      You dont know how lucky you are
      You shouldnt spend your whole life wishin
      For something bound to fall apart
      Everytime youre feeling empty
      Better thank your lucky stars
      If you ever felt one breaking
      Youd never want a heart
      Woo
      Hey there Mr Tin Man
      You dont know how lucky you are
      Ive been on the road that youre on
      It didnt get me very far
      You aint missing nothing
      Cause love is so damn hard
      Take it from me darling
      You dont want a heart
      Woooo
      Hey there Mr Tin Man
      Im glad we talked this out
      You can take mine if you want it
      Its in pieces now
      By the way there Mr Tin Man
      If you dont mind the scars
      You give me your armor
      And you can have my heart

      When it hurts this good you gotta play it twice
      Another vice
      All dressed up in a pretty black label
      Sweet salvation on a dining room table waiting on me
      Where the numb meets the lonely
      Its gone before it ever melts the ice
      Another vice
      Another call another bed I shouldnt crawl out of
      At  AM with shoes in my hand
      Said I wouldnt do it but I did it again
      And I know Ill be back tomorrow night oh
      Ill wear a tail like a leather jacket
      When the new wears off I dont even pack it
      If you need me
      Ill be where my reputation dont proceed me
      Maybe Im addicted to goodbyes

      Yesterday I thought I saw your shadow running round
      Its funny how things never change in this old town
      So far from the stars
      And I want to tell you everything
      The words I never got to say the first time around
      And I remember everything
      From when we were the children playing in this fairground
      Wish I was there with you now
      If the whole world was watching Id still dance with you
      Drive highways and byways to be there with you
      Over and over the only truth
      Everything comes back to you
      I saw that you moved on with someone new
      In the pub that we met hes got his arms around you
      Its so hard
      So Hard
      And I want to tell you everything
      The words I never got to say the first time around
      And I remember everything
      From when we were the children playing in this fairground
      Wish I was there with you now
      Cos if the whole world was watching Id still dance with you
      Drive highways and byways to be there with you
      Over and over the only truth
      Everything comes back to you
      You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
      Them butterflies they come alive when Im next to you
      Over and over the only truth
      Everything comes back to you
      And I know that its wrong
      That I cant move on
      But theres something about you
      If the whole world was watching Id still dance with you
      Drive highways and byways to be there with you
      Over and over the only truth
      Everything comes back to you
      You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
      Them butterflies they come alive when Im next to you
      Over and over the only truth
      Everything comes back to you
      Everything comes back to you"

The bitch gambled her career now its gon be severe
I just be watchin bitches pitfalls
Stopped doin pills but bitch dem withdrawals
I am in my mansion rockin pink drawers
I leveled up bitch I switched flows

Verse   Lil Wayne
No more CMB shit I changed it
Young Money shit Mula Gang shit
Different hoes doing the same shit
Poppin pills we dont know where the pain went
Lit like high beams sippin on my lean
Rippin off my wings knife out my spleen
Yeah Carter time I put bling on for the time
She changed her ringtone to one of mine I changed   s to   s
Lil Tune like autotune I get in her throat and she harmonize
She get the D and ooh la la la and when she leave I kumbaya
I whip it up with the left hand I dont fuck with the yes man
I get younger by the second I dont rust like Def Jam
Its a must I expand and flex on my exteam
Have sex on my jet ski text my chef told em Lets beef
Changing girls change is fine
She dont like girls change her mind
Change the world change my line
Never ever change my slimes
Changing looks changing lies changing skies changing lanes
Me Minaj and Champagne changed the game
And yall chump change

PreChorus Nicki Minaj

And when I come get your change cup

Fat ass and pretty titties
Get dummies for they money
You sent flowers but I wish I didnt receive em
All your lies I wish I didnt believe em

Hook Nicki Minaj
That boy is a real pussy pleaser
All that fetty but he never met Masika
Tuck the chrome    in his sneaker
El Chapo but he crazy like La Quica
Young girls always lookin for a soulmate
But I shoulda listened to what momma told me
Furry moon boots shades Dita
Too high to give a shit about PETA

Verse   Nicki Minaj
Sativa so strong Im not blinkin
What in the world was I thinkin
New day new money to be made
New things for them to imitate

Pretty face perfect body

Who the fuck is gon protect her
If I really gotta check her
Peter Piper picked a pepper
And my cake is triple decker

Interlude Nicki Minaj

Verse   Nicki Minaj

These bitches havin nightmares of my new shit
These bitches pussy and they dont ever do shit

Interlude Nicki Minaj
Yeah oh no no no no yeah oh no no no no

Verse   Nicki Minaj
Now usually I dont do this Im Popeye shes Brutus
Usually Im a Christian but this peace is Buddhist
All of my niggas draw but none of them cartoonists
Usually Im the baddest usually Im the cutest
Usually Im the flyest usually youre the stewardess
And we aint playin ball but usually its some shooters
Are these bitches drunk These bitches aint lucid
Go against the queen your career will be elusive
Where your plaques at Where them stocks Word to NASDAQ
Bitches assback they was never in my taxbrack
Yeah oh no no no no yeah oh no no no no

Outro Swae Lee
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world all her friends know of me
Young bull living like an old geezer
Quick release the cash watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air binge drinking
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

      Ya no me cansé no quiero ser tu amante
      Te digo de mi parte
      Que no aguanto más
      Ya no aguanto ver el otro como dice
      que es el dueño tuyo
      Me mata el orgullo
      El ni te sabe hablar
      Esta la hice pa él
      Cuando la escuche quiero estar allí para ver
      Cuando se entere y sepa que soy dueño de usted
      Tal vez suene un poco mal lo sé y no me luce
      Todo es por usted
      Mami yo me siento tuyo
      Yo sé que tú te sientes mía
      Dile al noviecito tuyo
      Que con él te sientes fría

      Solo una cosa te preguntaré
      Si tienes frío quién te da calor
      Yo soy el dueño de tu fantasía
      Nadie lo hace como yo
      Si te viste bonita él no te dice nada
      Y a mí tú me gustas hasta sin maquillar
      Tú siempre a mí me dices que él te trata mal
      Y eso lo tienes que acabar
      Dime qué tú vas a hacer
      Mami tengo la inquietud
      Si quieres sufrir con él
      Eso lo decides tú
      Que seas feliz con él yo no te contestaré
      Sé que me vas a llamar
      Cuando me extraña tu piel
      Mami yo me siento tuyo
      Yo sé que tú te sientes mía

       I wonder if Jack and Diane ever made it
       After the drums and the guitars all faded
       Was the best they could do good enough
       Or did the hard land just swallow em up
       How did my mom and my dad ever do it
       If there was struggles then we never knew it
       I guess they had each other
       That was enough

       No matter how hard you try

       What am I gonna tell my kids when they see all of this bullshit that goes down on TV
       When the whole world is down on its luck
       I gotta make sure they keep their chin up
       Cry when it hurts laugh when its funny
       Chase after the dream dont chase after the money
       And no we got each other

Verse  
I thought about you the other day
What the hell happened with you and me
Cause oh aint no lovin no more
You aint as cool as you used to be
Closer to the mirror than you are to me
I said oh had to show you that door

PreChorus
Someday I hope we can fix it cause I aint too proud to try
Say hi to your friends and if they ever ask you why
We dont talk

Chorus
Know you gotta grow up
Aint you sick of being immature
Talkin loud cause youre insecure
You always turn it up turn it up turn it up cmon
Why you always gotta show off
Youre so vain I already know
That when you hear this on the radio
Youre gonna turn it up turn it up turn it up

PostChorus
Cause its all about youoohoohoohoohoohoohoohooh
Its all about youoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohooh

Verse  
Now you said some stuff that you cant take back
How did you think that I would react
Cause you you must be out of your mind no
How did we go straight from love to hate
Now its so deep that we cant be mates
I said oh we should give it some time

PreChorus
Someday I hope we can fix it cause I aint too proud to try
Say hi to your friends and if they ever ask you why
We dont talk

Chorus
Know you gotta grow up
Aint you sick of being immature
Talkin loud cause youre insecure
You always turn it up turn it up turn it up cmon
Why you always gotta show off
Youre so vain I already know

Youre gonna turn it up turn it up turn it up

      I dont wanna be your lover
      I dont wanna be your fool
      Pick me up whenever you want it
      Throw me down when youre through
      Cause I learned more from whats missing
      Its about me and not about you
      I know I made some bad decisions
      But my last one was you
      Thanks to you I know lies lies lies
      How it feels when love dies dies dies
      And you taught me good bye bye bye
      How to know when its over when its over
      You dont know love till it
      Tears up your heart and cuts in it
      Leaves you with scars youre still feeling
      You dont know love
      You dont know love
      You say I cant do better
      Better than someone like you
      What I feel cant write in a letter
      So I wrote this for you
      Thanks to you I know lies lies lies
      How it feels when love dies dies dies
      And you taught me good bye bye bye
      How to know when its over when its over
      You dont know love till it tears up your heart
      Tears up your heart and cuts in it
      Leaves you with scars youre still feeling

      Cause we were done
      I remember we were sleeping in cars
      We were searching for OZ
      We were burning cigars
      With white plastics tips til we saw the sun
      And we said crazy things like
      I refuse to look back thinking days were better
      Just because theyre younger days
      I dont know whats round the corner
      Way I feel right now I swear well never change

      Lights down
      And we drive and were drivin just to get out

      Yeah we were swinging swinging from the rafters
      Hey we were dancing in cars
      We were looking for ours
      We were naming the stars

      Ill admit Im sorry when I feel Im truly sorry

      Never thought the circumstances woulda changed you
      You said you never traded no yeah you said that

      Just cause he got a heart dont mean he got heart
      Could be standing in a field and he still aint in the field
      If anything should change then I thought we had a deal
      Lately you keep questioning what you get out the deal
      Doing things to make me feel the way I make you feel
      How hard is it to let you know when Im coming home
      That way you can be prepared maybe take a couple sick days and not miss pay

      I dreamed it all ever since I was young
      They said I would be nothing
      Now they always say congratulations
      Worked so hard forgot how to vacation
      They aint never had the dedication
      People hatin say we changed and look we made it
      Yeah we made it
      I was patient yeahoh

      Now I can scream that we made it
      Now everyone everywhere I go they say gratulations

      Im looking for someone to call baby
      But right now I got a situation

      Big rings champagne

      A yellow bitch with green hair a real weirdo
      Black man yellow Lamb real life goals
      They seen that Guwop and them just came in through the side door
      Theres so much money on the floor we buyin school clothes
      Why you bring the money machine to the club for
      Pint of lean pound of weed and a kilo
      I eurostep past a hater like Im Rondo
      I upgrade your baby mama to a condo
      Like Chapos serving yayo to the gringos
      Black Beatle club close when I say so
      That girl is a real crowd pleaser
      Small world all her friends know of me
      Young bull living like an old geezer
      quickRelease the cash watch it fall slowly
      Frat girls still tryna get even
      Haters mad for whatever reason
      Smoke in the air binge drinking
      They lose it when the DJ drops the needle
      Shes a good teaser and we blowing reefer
      Your body like a work of art baby
      Dont  with me Ill break your heart baby
      DG on me I got a lot of flavor
         hundred on my feet Im tryna kill these haters
      I had haters when I was broke Im rich I still got haters
      I had hoes when I was broke Im rich Im still a player
      I wear leather Gucci jackets like its still the   s
      Ive been blowing OG Kush I feel a lil sedated
      I cant worry about a broke nigga or a hater
      Black Beatle bitch me and Paul McCartney related
      That girl is a real crowd pleaser
      Small world all her friends know of me
      Young bull living like an old geezer
      quickRelease the cash watch it fall slowly

      When I heard that sound
      When the walls came down
      I was thinking about you
      About you
      When my skin grows old
      When my breath runs cold
      Ill be thinking about you
      About you
      Seconds from my heart
      A bullet from the dark
      Helpless I surrender
      Shackled by your love
      Holding me like this
      With poison on your lips
      Only when its over
      The silence hits so hard
      Cause it was almost love it was almost love
      It was almost love it was almost love

      We bleed ourselves in vain
      How tragic is this game
      Turn around Im holding on to someone
      But the love is gone
      Carrying the load with wings that feel like stone
      Knowing that we nearly fell so far now
      Its hard to tell
      Yeah we came so close it was almost love
      It was almost love it was almost love
      When I heard that sound

      Ill be thinking about you about you
      While I reached out for your hand
      When the walls were caving in
      When I see you on the other side
      We can try all over again
      When I heard that sound
      When the walls came down

Verse  
Oh have you looked around
Have you heard the sound
Of Mamas crying
Or do you turn away
When you see the face
Of the innocent dying
In these darkest days
Are you not afraid
That its too late

Chorus  
You gotta get down on your knees
Believe fold your hands and beg and plead
Gotta keep on praying
You gotta cry rain tears of pain
Pound the floor and scream His name
Cause were still worth saving
Cant go on like this and live like this
We cant love like this
We gotta give this world
Back to God

Verse  
Have you lost a love
Do you feel like giving up
Has your heart been broken
Are your kids okay
Will they come home safe
Do you lie there hoping
You can make a wish
You can knock on wood
Ohh it wont do no good

Chorus  
You gotta get down on your knees
Believe fold your hands and beg and plead
Gotta keep on praying
You gotta cry rain tears of pain
Pound the floor and scream His name
Cause were still worth saving
Cant go on like this and live like this
We cant love like this
We gotta give this world
Back to God

Interlude

Chorus  
You gotta get down on your knees
Believe fold your hands and beg and plead
Keep on praying
You gotta cry rain tears of pain
Pound the floor and scream His name
Cause were still worth saving
Cant go on like this and live like this
We cant love like this
You can hope the best
Make a wish
The only answer is
We give this world back to God
Ohh give it back

      Spent enough that is on my heart
      Its like a better luck than a touch of dog
      You got a sneak attack from the zodiac
      But I see your bright spark
      Get the pleas and go
      Go my flow and go away what do you say
      You dont know my mind
      You dont know my kind

Intro
We got large and we got small
We got a swimming pool and a cannon ball
We turn red and we turn green
Its the craziest thing Ive ever seen

Verse  
Lost my mind cause Im on the plastic
Who knew its so damn drastic
Show me what it is you believe in
Slowly she sinks all her teeth in
Do you want to go fishing in New Orleans
Do you want to get up early in the morning
Take me to the river where we do the little storming
Hallelujah I feel it warming

PreChorus
Sitting here I count the moons
The orders we obeyed
Every night fore we go to bed
I watch while the others pray

Chorus
Send it off through Delaware just
Make it fair for the legionnaires
Paint a simple portrait of my kind
Permission to the heartless bombs
Gold Plated Hate and the waitress moms
Serving up the stories of my mind

Verse  
Mexico you are my neighbor
Home of the lets be braver
Give me all your sick and your tired
Races that we admire
Do you want to go dancing in Chicago
Trinidads got it bad for Tobago
Take me to the lake where we do the Avocado
Hallelujah a desparado

PreChorus
Sitting here I count the moons
The orders we obeyed
Every night fore we go to bed
I watch while the others pray

Chorus
Send it off through Delaware just
Make it fair for the legionnaires
Paint a simple portrait of my kind
Permission to the heartless bombs
Gold Plated Hate and the waitress moms
Serving up the stories of my mind
Coming down from the deserts where you
Caught a glimpse of the billionaire
Tell me Im the right one for the ride
Paper signs out on the lawns
Gold minds and the priceless pawns
Does your canyon really open wide

Outro
We got large and we got small
We got a swimming pool and a cannonball
We turn red and we turn green
Its the craziest thing Ive ever seen

PreChorus
But baby dont get it twisted

Didnt they tell you that I was a savage
Fuck ya white horse and ya carriage

To feel a little more and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby ooh you needed me

PreChorus
But baby dont get it twisted

I hit a wall I never felt so low so low
Like a waterfall my tears dropped to the floor the floor
They left a swimming pool of salted crimes crimes
Oh what could I do to change your mind
Nothing

PreChorus  
Im bracing for the pain and I am letting go
Im using all my strength to get out of this hole

Chorus
I hit a wall I thought that I would hurt myself
Oh I was sure your words would leave me unconscious
And on the floor Id be lying cold lifeless
But I hit a wall I hit em all watch the fall
Youre just another brick and Im a sledgehammer
Youre just another brick and Im a sledgehammer

Verse  
Yeah I hit a wall I prayed that I would make it through make it through
I can survive a life thats without you thats without you yeah
And I will rise up from the ashes now the ashes now
Oh the sparrow flies with just the crumbs of loving spilled yeah

PreChorus  
I was bracing for the pain and then I let it go
I gathered all my strength and I found myself whole

Chorus
I hit a wall I thought that I would hurt myself
Oh I was sure your words would leave me unconscious
And on the floor Id be lying cold lifeless
But I hit a wall I hit em all watch the fall
Youre just another brick and Im a sledgehammer
Youre just another brick and Im a sledgehammer
Youre just another brick and Im a sledgehammer
Youre just another brick and Im a sledgehammer

Verso  
Estoy planeando un secuestro
Para robarme tu amor
Mis estrategias no marchan
Y crece la imaginación

Vivo en un mundo ficticio
Con un sólo compromiso
Conquistarte y darte toda mi atención
Pero tus padres te entregan a otro hombre
Que apenas tú conoces
Y yo aquí sin solución

Coro
Yo quisiera ser el Hulk y te protejo
Superman para exhibirte el universo
Si fuese Batman no habría noches de temor
La Baticueva nuestro nidito de amor

Si yo fuera El Hombre Araña por un beso
Cien pies de altura escalo sin esfuerzo a tu balcón
Y si alguien te pregunta por tu héroe favorito
Dile que soy yo

Verso  
Veo un planeta en mis sueños
Ahí nos vamos a amar
Con mi espada te rescato
De nada cuesta soñar

Yo hiciera lo imposible
Siendo El Hombre Invisible
Y te rapto tan ligero como Flash
Pero sólo son escenas historietas que no pegan
No hay poderes yo no tengo agilidad

Coro
Yo quisiera ser el Hulk y te protejo
Superman para exhibirte el universo
Si fuese Batman no habría noches de temor
La Baticueva nuestro nidito de amor

Si yo fuera El Hombre Araña por un beso
Cien pies de altura escalo sin esfuerzo a tu balcón
Y si alguien te pregunta por tu héroe favorito
Dile que soy yo

Puente
Thats the golden touch right there
The king is back
I wanna be your super hero
Your paladin of love
Youve got that baby

Coro
Yo quisiera ser el Hulk y te protejo
Superman para exhibirte el universo
Si fuese Batman no habría noches de temor
La Baticueva nuestro nidito de amor

Si yo fuera El Hombre Araña
Por tus besos     pies de altura escalo sin esfuerzo a tu balcón
Y si alguien te pregunta súper héroe favorito
Pues dile que soy yo pues dile que soy yo

      Shes falling but she doesnt think hell catch her
      Cause her last relationship was a disaster
      Accusations everyday she didnt know why
      All her calls would be ignored hes on his own time
      Shoulda ended it before it started
      All she ever got was broken hearted
      He was cheating on her tryna flip it
      Back on her like a victim
      Now shes all alone and starting over
      Now shes got baggage on her shoulder
      But the new guy really loves her
      She loves him but she doesnt trust herself anymore
      Shes fallin in love now
      Losin control now
      Fightin the truth
      Tryin to hide
      But I think its alright girl
      Yeah I think its alright girl

      Fightin the truth
      Tryin to hide
      But I think its alright girl
      Yeah I think its alright girl
      Despite her past she cant help the attraction
      He tells her that hes nothing like the last one
      He redefines in every way what love is
      She fell for him and hasnt gotten up since
      Every now and then she goes off though
      Beating on his chest like a bongo
      He understands shes coming from a hurt place
      Answers all the questions on her survery
      Doesnt get jealous doesnt break trust
      Doesnt call a hoe after hang ups
      Gives her everything she ever wanted
      And even though she still feels haunted
      Shes fallin in love now
      Losin control now
      Fightin the truth
      Tryin to hide
      But I think its alright girl
      Yeah I think its alright girl
      Fallin in love now

      No where to go and no place to call home

      And even sometimes he would go away too

      I saw a shadow flying high
      
      He came to me with the sweetest smile
      
      Told me he wanted to talk for awhile
      He said peter pan thats what they call me

      Believe in him and believe in me
      Together we will fly away in a cloud of green
      
      To your beautiful destiny

      First time I seen her walk by man I bout fell off my chair
      Had to get her number it took me like six weeks
      Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats
      Body like a back road drivin with my eyes closed
      I know every curve like the back of my hand

      Ima take it slow just as fast as I can
      
      The way she fit in them blue jeans she dont need no belt
      But I can turn them inside out I dont need no help
      Got hips like honey so thick and so sweet
      It aint no curves like hers on them downtown streets
      Body like a back road drivin with my eyes closed
      I know every curve like the back of my hand
      Doin    in a    I aint in no hurry
      Ima take it slow just as fast as I can
      
      Were out here in the boondocks
      With the breeze and the birds
      Tangled up in the tall grass
      With my lips on hers
      On the highway to heaven
      Headed south of her smile
      Get there when we get there
      Every inch is a mile
      Body like a back road drivin with my eyes closed
      I know every curve like the back of my hand
      Doin    in a    I aint in no hurry

      Oh I drink and take a sip of it
      Feelin like a hypocrite
      Go for more and I dont give a shit
      I never used to talk I never used to talk like this
      Im sorry I named the album Montevallo
      And Im sorry people know your name now
      strangers hit you up on social media
      Im sorry you cant listen to the radio
      And drive out to the place we used to get peaches down in Pelham
      I know you want your privacy
      And youve got nothing to say to me
      But I wish youd let me pay off your student loans to these songs you gave to me
      Member the first time you stayed with me
      Overpacked and drove up and went to the CMAs with me
      Two years later it felt like you were a million miles away from me
      And I was the one on stage drunk
      Barely holdin on on ABC
      Hope your dad still prays for me
      Drinkin too much drinkin too much
      Since you been gone I cant get gone enough
      Im on top of the world Im going down
      Im gonna drink it all til youre not around
      Drinkin too much drinkin too much
      Since you been gone I cant get gone enough
      Im on top of the world Im going down
      Im gonna drink it all til youre not around
      A year ago I was in a hotel room in Pheonix
      Wonderin if its ever OK to lie
      Cause I knew the truth would make you wanna die
      But I told you everything and you told me to have a good life
      But you still couldnt believe it was really goodbye
      Every night youd fill the bathtub up
      Lie there for hours put your face under water and cry
      I never wanted to be a heartbreaker
      Turn your sisters and friends into matchmakers
      I know you think my dreams came true
      Since you been gone
      Singin these songs are just something to do
      Every dream I ever had was you
      Hope you know Im still in love
      Its the kind you cant fall out of
      Drinkin too much drinkin too much
      Since you been gone I cant get gone enough
      Im on top of the world Im going down
      Im gonna drink it all til youre not around
      Drinkin too much drinkin too much
      Since you been gone I cant get gone enough
      Im on top of the world Im going down
      Im gonna drink it all til youre not around
      I know this might seem like a contradiction
      And the last thing you need is more unwanted attention
      But you changed your number and moved
      And this is the only way I could reach you
      So wherever you are turn it up and listen
      Hannah Lee Im on my way to you
      Nobody can love you like I do
      I dont know what Im gonna say to you
      But I know there aint no way I know there aint no way
      No there aint no way were through"

      You hear a new song its your favorite
      Pretty soon youll be changing the station
      And all your old shoes are looking brand new
      They wanna be worn but they never get the chance too
      Heavy into everything
      Ready for the next thing
      Catch a ride for a while than youre over it
      You change your mind on it
      Soon as the shines gone
      Like you always do but you dont know it yet but
      Woahhhhh whoahhh
      I aint gonna be that easy to leave
      Woahhhh whoahhh
      Girl Im gonna make you miss me
      Make you wish that you were sleeping in my shirt
      Lie about my jacket and tell everyone its yours
      When your phone rings after midnight and youre thinking maybe its me
      Gonna make you miss me
      Youre cold and hot
      You burn out like a match
      Keep the slip knot and the strings you attach
      You think its easy but thats a lie
      The only reason that youre good at goodbye is
      Every boy you ever met was to easy to forget
      Well I aint going out like that
      Woahhh whoahh
      I aint gonna be that easy to leave
      Woahhh whoahhh

      Make you wish that you were sleeping in my shirt
      Lie about my jacket and tell everyone its yours

      Im gonna make you miss me
      Woahhh whoahh
      I aint gonna be that easy to leave
      Woahhhh whoahhh
      Girl Im gonna make you miss me
      Writing letters that youre never gonna mail
      Stay up and paint my favorite shade of red on your nails
      Cause you cant fall asleep and youre wishing you were with me
      Im gonna make you miss me
      Make you miss me
      Make you miss the way my hand fit in your hand
      When youre dialing my number listening to my favorite bands
      Ill say baby you know all you can say
      Is come and get me
      Wanna make you miss me
      Gonna make you miss me

alFive More Minutes
       Eight years old a couple cane poles sitting down by the creek
       Lines in the water watching those bobbers seeing that red sun sink
       Mamas on the porch yelling suppers hot yall come and get it
       We yelled five more minutes
       At sixteen it was twelve o three standing at her front door
       Katies dad said midnight but we needed just a little more
       Yellow light flipping on and off and were up to that goodnight kissing
       We wanted five more minutes
       Time rolls by the clock dont stop
       I wish I had a few more drops
       Of the good stuff the good times
       Oh but they just keep on flying
       Right on by like it aint nothing
       Wish I had me a pause button
       Moments like those lord knows Id hit it
       Give myself five more minutes
       At eighteen turned my helmet in and walked to the fifty yard line
       Its just the coach and me after we lost eighteen to nine
       And I cried man next time to get in here
       Ill have to buy a ticket
       Cant you give me five more minutes
       Time rolls by the clock dont stop
       I wish I had a few more drops
       Of the good stuff the good times
       Oh but they just keep on flying
       Right on by like it aint nothing
       Wish I had me a pause button
       Moments like those lord knows Id hit it
       Give myself five more minutes
       At eighty six my grandpa said theres angels in the room
       All the family gathered round we knew that time was coming soon
       So much left to say I prayed lord I aint finished
       Just give us five more minutes
       Time rolls by the clock dont stop
       I wish I had a few more drops
       Of the good stuff the good times
       Oh but they just keep on flying
       Right on by like it aint nothing
       Wish I had me a pause button
       Moments like those lord knows Id hit it
       Yeah sometimes this all life will leave you wishing
       That you had five more minutes

      I was walking down the street the other day
      Tryna distract myself
      But then I see your face
      Oh wait thats someone else
      Tryna play it coy
      Tryna make it disappear
      But just like the battle of Troy
      Theres nothing settled here
      In my room theres a king size space
      Bigger than it used to be
      If you want you can rent that place
      Call me an amenity
      Even if its in my dreams
      Oooh youre taking up a fraction of my mind
      Ooooh every time I watch you serpentine
      Im trying
      Not to think about you
      No no no
      Not to think about you
      No no no
      Im trying
      Not to give in to you
      No no no
      Not to give it to you
      With my feelings on fire
      Guess Im a bad liar
      I see how your attention builds
      Its like looking in a mirror
      Your touch like a happy pill
      But still all we do is fear
      What could possibly happen next
      Can we focus on the love
      Paint my kiss across your chest
      Feel the art Ill be the brush
      Ooh youre taking all perfection out my mind
      Ooooh every time I watch you serpentine
      Im trying
      Not to think about you
      No no no
      Not to think about you
      No no no
      Im trying
      Not to give it to you
      No no no
      Not to give it to you
      All my feelings on fire
      Guess Im a bad liar
      And oh baby lets make reality actuality a reality
      oh baby lets make reality actuality a reality
      Im trying
      Not to think about you

The girl next door ya know
Man

Say it wasnt you

Chorus Rikrok
Honey came in and she caught me redhanded
Creepin with the girl next door
Picture this we were both butt naked
Bangin on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me

Verse   Shaggy
How ya fi give ya woman access to your villa
Trespass and a witness all the hacklin on the pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killer
Best review the situation that you caught up inna
To be a true player you haffi know how fi play
If she say a night convince her say a day
Never admit to a word what she say
And if she claim a yuh tell her Baby no way

PreChorus Rikrok  Shaggy
But she caught me on the counter Wasnt me
Saw me bangin on the sofa Wasnt me
I even had her in the shower Wasnt me
She even caught me on camera Wasnt me
She saw the marks on my shoulder Wasnt me
Heard the words that I told her Wasnt me
Heard the screams getting louder Wasnt me
She stayed until it was over

Chorus Rikrok
Honey came in and she caught me redhanded
Creepin with the girl next door
Picture this we were both butt naked

Why should she believe me
When I told her it wasnt me

Bridge Rikrok
Wanna tell her that Im sorry
For the pain that Ive caused
Ive been listenin to your reason

People tell her that Im sorry
For the pain that Ive caused
You may think that youre a player
But youre completely lost
Thats why I sing

      And itll keep you up from Thursday to Saturday night
      What do you like
      When you smoke with the Dogg you had the time of your life

      Boys hating Im just counting up the money I just made
      And what Im making make a nia make a million dollars later
      Smoking getting high pays
      I like my eyes glazed
      Aint empty out my ashtray in days
      At my house playing pool in some HUF socks and Joyrich sweats
      I roll a joint you roll another one next
      Cant even name a nia colder than

You know Im sorry

Got caught up in my own selfishness
It wont let me be a part of this
And I know Ive started
Drifting off every second
I cant wait to leave as soon as I
Arrive I count the seconds

Well torch this place we know
Before one of us takes a chance
And breaks this I wont be the one

I know its pathetic
Fuck it yeah I said it
Tried to tell it like it is
Theres a chance that Ill regret it so
Lets go lets end this
I delete before I send it
And we can play pretend
Like we havent reached the end yet

Verse  
Coming out of my cage and Ive been doing just fine
Gotta gotta be down because I want it all
It started out with a kiss how did it end up like this
It was only a kiss it was only a kiss
Now Im falling asleep and shes calling a cab
While hes having a smoke and shes taking a drag
Now theyre going to bed and my stomach is sick
And its all in my head but shes touching his

PreChorus
Chest now he takes off her dress now
Let me go
I just cant look its killing me
And taking control

Chorus
Jealousy turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies choking on your alibis
But its just the price I pay destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes cause Im Mr Brightside

      It was christmas eve babe
      In the drunk tank
      An old man said to me wont see another one
      And then he sang a song
      The rare old mountain dew
      I turned my face away
      And dreamed about you
      God Im a lucky one
      Came in eighteen to one
      Ive got a feeling
      This years for me and you
      So happy Christmas
      I love you baby
      I can see a better time
      When all our dreams come true
      Theyve got cars big as bars
      Theyve got rivers of gold
      But the wind goes right through you
      Its no place for the old
      When you first took my hand
      On a cold christmas eve
      You promised me
      Broadway was waiting for me
      You were handsome
      You were pretty
      Queen of new york city
      When the band finished playing
      They howled out for more
      Sinatra was swinging
      All the drunks they were singing
      We kissed on a corner
      Then danced through the night
      The boys of the nypd choir
      Were singing galway bay
      And the bells were ringing out
      For christmas day
      Youre a bum
      Youre a punk
      Youre an old slut on junk
      Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed
      You scumbag you maggot
      You cheap lousy faggot
      Happy christmas your arse
      I pray god its our last
      The boys of the nypd choir
      Still singing galway bay
      And the bells are ringing out
      For christmas day
      I could have been someone
      Well so could anyone
      You took my dreams from me
      When i first found you
      I kept them with me babe
      I put them with my own
      Cant make it all alone
      Ive built my dreams around you
      The boys of the nypd choir
      Still singing galway bay
      And the bells are ringing out

      Smoking weed man
      I beg your pardon
      Its true the rumors that they start gone make us break apart
      Assuming theyve influenced all this sudden change of heart
      The voice recording take off with the whole thing
      Mind them that they know me
      No way you think if ever I decide to cut my hair like Abel
      Just like Jaden Smith Ill probably walk around all day with it
      Okay you lame Im aokay with it
      Might take the paper around my old ways
      Mind them that they know me
      Cause you know me you know me

The stars and the charts
And the cards make sense
Only when we want them to
When I lie awake staring in to space
I see a different view

      Im a little more bust ya back than take it for free
      And thats how Ill always be
      Im a little more lose my temper than to sit on back
      Im a little more ol Hank Williams than that trendy crap
      I love a flat wood ol front porch made of an old oak tree
      And thats how Ill always be
      
      Ill always be a fan of ol stray dogs and guitars playin
      One room churches back road walks and front porch swingin
      Sunset skies bonfire nights I love the simple things
      Thats how Ill always be
      
      I got friends that say I live a little like cool hand Luke
      Fast cars and motorcycles raisin hell in cowboy boots
      But hey on Sunday morning Ill take the back row seat
      Thats how Ill always be
      
      Ill always be a fan of ol stray dogs and guitars playin
      One room churches back road walks and front porch swingin
      Sunset skies bonfire nights I love the simple things
      Thats how Ill always be
      
      Im a fan of chert rock bouncing off a Chevy fender
      That feeling that you get that first time she lets ya kiss her
      Rusty roofs that rattle when the rain is fallin down
      Handshake deals fresh cut hay fields and hometowns
      
      Ill always be a fan of ol stray dogs and guitars playin
      One room churches back road walks and front porch swingin
      Sunset skies bonfire nights I love the simple things

Well he just might like to know
Hes put a great big smile on somebodys face
If you jump into your bed
Quickly cover up your head
Dont you lock the doors you know that sweet Santa Claus is on the way
Well I wish it could be Christmas everyday
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play
Oh I wish it could be Christmas everyday
Let the bells ring out for Christmas
When were skating in the park
If the storm cloud paints it dark
Then your rosy cheeks gonna light my merry way
Now the frosticles appear
And theyve frozen up my beard
So well lie by the fire till the sleep simply melts them all away
Well I wish it could be Christmas everyday
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play
Oh I wish it could be Christmas everyday
So let the bells ring out for Christmas
Solo
When the snowman brings the snow
Well he just might like to know
Hes put a great big smile on somebodys face
So if Santa brings that sleigh
All along the milky way
Ill sign my name on the rooftop in the snow then he may decide to stay
Well I wish it could be Christmas everyday
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play
Oh I wish it could be Christmas everyday
So let the bells ring out for Christmas
OK you lot Take It
Chorus sung by children
Well I wish it could be Christmas everyday
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play
Oh I wish it could be Christmas everyday
Let the bells ring out for Christmas
Why dont you give your love for Christmas"

Pour me another one
Make it a strong one
Were gonna have some fun tonight

I wanna be a castaway
And leave the world behind
Take a tropic holiday
Say goodbye to keeping time
Wasting away down by the coast
Pacifico and chasing lime
Easy living down in paradise

Pour me another one
Make it a strong one
Were gonna have some fun tonight
Just like the other one
Make it a double rum
Were gonna castaway tonight

Im in an island state of mind
Dont think Im ever gonna leave
Id rather stay and watch the waves
Move the sand beneath my feet
Reggae on the radio
Laying low and feeling high
Easy living down in paradise

Pour me another one
Make it a strong one
Were gonna have some fun tonight
Just like the other one
Make it a double rum
Were gonna castaway tonight
Castaway

Chorus
Castaway
Ride the waves like were young
Cause time flies by and soon well be older
Its better to live in the moment
Than stuck in the past
Fast asleep as the world passes by

Ay ay yo
Where reality is history
Oh yo eh
Come and castaway with me
Ay ay yo
The good times are free and
Nobody can take that away
Oh yo eh
Come and castaway with me

Pour me another one
Smiling in the islands Ive been
Make it a strong one
Were gonna have some fun tonight
For a little while Ill be a castaway
Gonna let the sun shine in
Just like the other one
Smiling in the islands Ive been
Make it a double rum
Were gonna castaway tonight
For a little while Ill be a castaway
Gonna let the sunshine in

Pour me another one
Smiling in the islands Ive been
Make it a strong one
Were gonna have some fun tonight
For a little while Ill be a castaway
Gonna let the sun shine in

Its buried deep inside me but I feel theres somethin you should know

I will never forget you
You will always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you til the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart I will always be sure
I will never forget you
And you will always be by my side til the day I die

Verse   MNEK
Funny how we both end up here but everything seems so right
I wonder what would happen if we went back and put up a fight
Cause once upon a time you were my everything
Its clear to see that time hasnt changed a thing
So what in this world do you think could ever take you off my mind Take you off my mind

And all along I knew I had somethin special with you
But sometimes you just gotta know that these things fall through
But Im still tied and I cant hide my connection with you
Feelin it lovin it everything that we do
And all along I knew I had something special with you
But sometimes you just gotta know that these things fall through
I cant hide my connection with you

Chorus Zara Larsson  MNEK MNEK

And you will always be by my side You will always be my

방탄소년단의 A Supplementary Story You Never Walk Alone 가사

Suga
예 신은 왜 자꾸만
우릴 외롭게 할까
Oh no no no no no no
예 상처투성일지라도
웃을 수 있어 함께라면
홀로 걷는 이 길의 끝에
뭐가 있든 발 디뎌볼래
때론 지치고 아파도
괜찮아 니 곁이니까
너와 나 함께라면
웃을 수 있으니까

JHope
날고 싶어도
내겐 날개가 없지
But 너의 그 손이
내 날개가 돼
어둡고 외로운 것들은
잊어볼래
너와 함께
이 날개는 아픔에서
돋아났지만
빛을 향한 날개야
힘들고 아프더라도
날아갈 수 있다면 날 테야
더는 두렵지 않게
내 손을 잡아줄래
너와 나 함께라면
웃을 수 있으니깐

RM
내가 선택한 길이고
모두 다 내가 만들어낸
운명이라 해도
내가 지은 죄이고
이 모든 생이
내가 치러갈 죗값일
뿐이라 해도

넌 같이 걸어줘
나와 같이 날아줘
하늘 끝까지
손 닿을 수 있도록
이렇게 아파도
너와 나 함께라면
웃을 수 있으니까

Jungkook Jimin V Jin
Ayy I never walk alone
잡은 너의 손 너의 온기가 느껴져
Ayy you never walk alone
나를 느껴봐 너도 혼자가 아니야
Come on crawl crawlcrawl
crawl it like it like that
Baby walk walk walk
walk it like it like that
Baby run run run
run it like it like that
Baby fly fly fly
fly it like it like that

이 길이 또 멀고 험할지라도
함께 해주겠니
넘어지고 때론 다칠지라도
함께 해주겠니

Ayy I never walk alone
너와 나 함께라면 웃을 수 있으니까
Ayy You never walk alone
너와 나 함께라면 웃을 수 있으니까
너와 나 함께라면 웃을 수 있으니까

Verse   RM JHope
보고 싶다 이렇게
말하니까 더 보고 싶다
너희 사진을
보고 있어도 보고 싶다
너무 야속한 시간
나는 우리가 밉다
이젠 얼굴 한 번 보는 것 조차
힘들어진 우리가

Verse   RM
여긴 온통 겨울 뿐이야
팔월에도 겨울이 와
마음은 시간을 달려가네
홀로 남은 설국열차
니 손 잡고 지구
반대편까지 가
겨울을 끝내고파
그리움들이
얼마나 눈처럼 내려야
그 봄날이 올까
Friend

Verse   Jimin  V
허공을 떠도는
작은 먼지처럼
작은 먼지처럼
날리는 눈이 나라면
조금 더 빨리 네게
닿을 수 있을 텐데

PreChorus   Jungkook  V
눈꽃이 떨어져요
또 조금씩 멀어져요
보고 싶다 보고 싶다
보고 싶다 보고 싶다
얼마나 기다려야
또 몇 밤을 더 새워야
널 보게 될까 널 보게 될까
만나게 될까 만나게 될까

Chorus JungkookJinJHope
추운 겨울 끝을 지나
다시 봄날이 올 때까지
꽃 피울 때까지
그곳에 좀 더 머물러줘
머물러줘

Verse   Suga  Jimin
니가 변한 건지
니가 변한 건지
아니면 내가 변한 건지
아니면 내가 변한 건지
이 순간 흐르는 시간조차 미워
우리가 변한 거지 뭐
모두가 그런 거지 뭐

Verse   Suga  Jimin
그래 밉다 니가
넌 떠났지만
단 하루도 너를
잊은 적이 없었지 난
솔직히 보고 싶은데
이만 너를 지울게
그게 널 원망하기보단
덜 아프니까

Verse   Jin  Jimin
시린 널 불어내 본다
연기처럼 하얀 연기처럼
말로는 지운다 해도
사실 난 아직 널 보내지 못하는데

눈꽃이 떨어져요
또 조금씩 멀어져요

영원할 순 없으니까
